enhancing multi-modality Vision Language Models (VLMs). Despite the
advancements in VLMs facilitating basic visual dialog and reasoning, a
performance gap persists compared to advanced models like GPT-4 and Gemini. We
try to narrow the gap by mining the potential of VLMs for better performance
and any-to-any workflow from three aspects, i.e., high-resolution visual
tokens, high-quality data, and VLM-guided generation. To enhance visual tokens,
we propose to utilize an additional visual encoder for high-resolution
refinement without increasing the visual token count. We further construct a
high-quality dataset that promotes precise image comprehension and
reasoning-based generation, expanding the operational scope of current VLMs. In
general, Mini-Gemini further mines the potential of VLMs and empowers current
frameworks with image understanding, reasoning, and generation simultaneously.
Mini-Gemini supports a series of dense and MoE Large Language Models (LLMs)
from 2B to 34B. It is demonstrated to achieve leading performance in several
zero-shot benchmarks and even surpasses the developed private models. Code and
models are available at https://github.com/dvlab-research/MiniGemini.

                                        <span>  The rise of Modular Deep Learning showcases its potential in various Natural
Language Processing applications. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
modularity has been shown to work for various use cases, from domain adaptation
to multilingual setups. However, all this work covers the case where the
modular components are trained and deployed within one single Pre-trained
Language Model (PLM). This model-specific setup is a substantial limitation on
the very modularity that modular architectures are trying to achieve. We ask
whether current modular approaches are transferable between models and whether
we can transfer the modules from more robust and larger PLMs to smaller ones.
In this work, we aim to fill this gap via a lens of Knowledge Distillation,
commonly used for model compression, and present an extremely straightforward
approach to transferring pre-trained, task-specific PEFT modules between
same-family PLMs. Moreover, we propose a method that allows the transfer of
modules between incompatible PLMs without any change in the inference
complexity. The experiments on Named Entity Recognition, Natural Language
Inference, and Paraphrase Identification tasks over multiple languages and PEFT
methods showcase the initial potential of transferable modularity.

                                        <span>  Mitigation of gender bias in NLP has a long history tied to debiasing static
word embeddings. More recently, attention has shifted to debiasing pre-trained
language models. We study to what extent the simplest projective debiasing
methods, developed for word embeddings, can help when applied to BERT's
internal representations. Projective methods are fast to implement, use a small
number of saved parameters, and make no updates to the existing model
parameters. We evaluate the efficacy of the methods in reducing both intrinsic
bias, as measured by BERT's next sentence prediction task, and in mitigating
observed bias in a downstream setting when fine-tuned. To this end, we also
provide a critical analysis of a popular gender-bias assessment test for
quantifying intrinsic bias, resulting in an enhanced test set and new bias
measures. We find that projective methods can be effective at both intrinsic
bias and downstream bias mitigation, but that the two outcomes are not
necessarily correlated. This finding serves as a warning that intrinsic bias
test sets, based either on language modeling tasks or next sentence prediction,
should not be the only benchmark in developing a debiased language model.

                                        <span>  Large language models (LLMs) often generate content that contains factual
errors when responding to fact-seeking prompts on open-ended topics. To
benchmark a model's long-form factuality in open domains, we first use GPT-4 to
generate LongFact, a prompt set comprising thousands of questions spanning 38
topics. We then propose that LLM agents can be used as automated evaluators for
long-form factuality through a method which we call Search-Augmented Factuality
Evaluator (SAFE). SAFE utilizes an LLM to break down a long-form response into
a set of individual facts and to evaluate the accuracy of each fact using a
multi-step reasoning process comprising sending search queries to Google Search
and determining whether a fact is supported by the search results. Furthermore,
we propose extending F1 score as an aggregated metric for long-form factuality.
To do so, we balance the percentage of supported facts in a response
(precision) with the percentage of provided facts relative to a hyperparameter
representing a user's preferred response length (recall).
  Empirically, we demonstrate that LLM agents can achieve superhuman rating
performance - on a set of ~16k individual facts, SAFE agrees with crowdsourced
human annotators 72% of the time, and on a random subset of 100 disagreement
cases, SAFE wins 76% of the time. At the same time, SAFE is more than 20 times
cheaper than human annotators. We also benchmark thirteen language models on
LongFact across four model families (Gemini, GPT, Claude, and PaLM-2), finding
that larger language models generally achieve better long-form factuality.
LongFact, SAFE, and all experimental code are available at
https://github.com/google-deepmind/long-form-factuality.

generally language-, region-, and in some cases, device-dependent, which
increases the effort to scale and maintain them. Combining NNLMs for one or
more of the categories is one way to improve scalability. In this work, we
combine regional variants of English to build a ``World English'' NNLM for
on-device VAs. In particular, we investigate the application of adapter
bottlenecks to model dialect-specific characteristics in our existing
production NNLMs {and enhance the multi-dialect baselines}. We find that
adapter modules are more effective in modeling dialects than specializing
entire sub-networks. Based on this insight and leveraging the design of our
production models, we introduce a new architecture for World English NNLM that
meets the accuracy, latency, and memory constraints of our single-dialect

                                        <span>  We introduce CheckEval, a novel evaluation framework using Large Language
Models, addressing the challenges of ambiguity and inconsistency in current
evaluation methods. CheckEval addresses these challenges by dividing evaluation
criteria into detailed sub-aspects and constructing a checklist of Boolean
questions for each, simplifying the evaluation. This approach not only renders
the process more interpretable but also significantly enhances the robustness
and reliability of results by focusing on specific evaluation dimensions.
Validated through a focused case study using the SummEval benchmark, CheckEval
indicates a strong correlation with human judgments. Furthermore, it
demonstrates a highly consistent Inter-Annotator Agreement. These findings
highlight the effectiveness of CheckEval for objective, flexible, and precise
evaluations. By offering a customizable and interactive framework, CheckEval
sets a new standard for the use of LLMs in evaluation, responding to the
evolving needs of the field and establishing a clear method for future
LLM-based evaluation.

                                        <span>  Protolanguage reconstruction is central to historical linguistics. The
comparative method, one of the most influential theoretical and methodological
frameworks in the history of the language sciences, allows linguists to infer
protoforms (reconstructed ancestral words) from their reflexes (related modern
words) based on the assumption of regular sound change. Not surprisingly,
numerous computational linguists have attempted to operationalize comparative
reconstruction through various computational models, the most successful of
which have been supervised encoder-decoder models, which treat the problem of
predicting protoforms given sets of reflexes as a sequence-to-sequence problem.
We argue that this framework ignores one of the most important aspects of the
comparative method: not only should protoforms be inferable from cognate sets
(sets of related reflexes) but the reflexes should also be inferable from the
protoforms. Leveraging another line of research -- reflex prediction -- we
propose a system in which candidate protoforms from a reconstruction model are
reranked by a reflex prediction model. We show that this more complete
implementation of the comparative method allows us to surpass state-of-the-art
protoform reconstruction methods on three of four Chinese and Romance datasets.

generation and improved the programming efficiency of human developers.
However, their self-refinement capability is typically overlooked by the
existing evaluations of code LMs, which focus only on the accuracy of the
one-time prediction. For the cases when code LMs fail to implement the correct
program, developers actually find it hard to debug and fix the faulty
prediction since it is not written by the developers themselves. Unfortunately,
our study reveals that code LMs cannot efficiently self-refine their faulty
generations as well.
  In this paper, we propose CYCLE framework, learning to self-refine the faulty
generation according to the available feedback, such as the execution results
reported by the test suites. We evaluate CYCLE on three popular code generation
benchmarks, HumanEval, MBPP, and APPS. The results reveal that CYCLE
successfully maintains, sometimes improves, the quality of one-time code
generation, while significantly improving the self-refinement capability of
code LMs. We implement four variants of CYCLE with varied numbers of parameters
across 350M, 1B, 2B, and 3B, and the experiments show that CYCLE consistently
boosts the code generation performance, by up to 63.5%, across benchmarks and
varied model sizes. We also notice that CYCLE outperforms code LMs that have
3$\times$ more parameters in self-refinement.

                                        <span>  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly adept at generating
contextually detailed and coherent responses from visual inputs. However, their
application in multimodal decision-making and open-ended generation is hindered
by a notable rate of hallucinations, where generated text inaccurately
represents the visual contents. To address this issue, this paper introduces
the Instruction Contrastive Decoding (ICD) method, a novel approach designed to
reduce hallucinations during LVLM inference. Our method is inspired by our
observation that what we call disturbance instructions significantly exacerbate
hallucinations in multimodal fusion modules. ICD contrasts distributions from
standard and instruction disturbance, thereby increasing alignment uncertainty
and effectively subtracting hallucinated concepts from the original
distribution. Through comprehensive experiments on discriminative benchmarks
(POPE and MME) and a generative benchmark (LLaVa-Bench), we demonstrate that
ICD significantly mitigates both object-level and attribute-level
hallucinations. Moreover, our method not only addresses hallucinations but also
significantly enhances the general perception and recognition capabilities of
LVLMs.

results in a lower number of available benchmarks to evaluate the performance
of language models in Italian.
  This work presents two new benchmarks to evaluate the models performance on
mathematical understanding and language understanding in Italian. These
benchmarks are based on real tests that are undertaken by students of age
between 11 and 18 within the Italian school system and have therefore been
validated by several experts in didactics and pedagogy.
  To validate this dataset we evaluate the performance of 9 language models
that are the best performing when writing in Italian, including our own
fine-tuned models. We show that this is a challenging benchmark where current
language models are bound by 60\% accuracy.
  We believe that the release of this dataset paves the way for improving
future models mathematical and language understanding in Italian.

of tasks, particularly in language generation. Previous studies have found that
the performance of neural models frequently adheres to predictable scaling
laws, correlated with factors such as training set size and model size. This
insight is invaluable, especially as large-scale experiments grow increasingly
resource-intensive. Yet, such scaling law has not been fully explored in dense
retrieval due to the discrete nature of retrieval metrics and complex
relationships between training data and model sizes in retrieval tasks. In this
study, we investigate whether the performance of dense retrieval models follows
the scaling law as other neural models. We propose to use contrastive
log-likelihood as the evaluation metric and conduct extensive experiments with
dense retrieval models implemented with different numbers of parameters and
trained with different amounts of annotated data. Results indicate that, under
our settings, the performance of dense retrieval models follows a precise
power-law scaling related to the model size and the number of annotations.
Additionally, we examine scaling with prevalent data augmentation methods to
assess the impact of annotation quality, and apply the scaling law to find the
best resource allocation strategy under a budget constraint. We believe that
these insights will significantly contribute to understanding the scaling
effect of dense retrieval models and offer meaningful guidance for future
research endeavors.

constitutes one of major challenges in the AI field. In our work, we explore
paradigm introduced by Inference-Time-Intervention (ITI). In first stage, it
identifies attention heads, which contain the highest amount of desired type of
knowledge (e.g., truthful). Afterwards, during inference, LLM activations are
shifted for chosen subset of attention heads. We further improved the ITI
framework by introducing a nonlinear probing and multi-token intervention -
Non-Linear ITI (NL-ITI). NL-ITI is tested on diverse multiple-choice
benchmarks, including TruthfulQA, on which we report around 14% MC1 metric
improvement with respect to the baseline ITI results. NL-ITI achieves also
encouraging results on other testsets - on Business Ethics subdomain of MMLU,
around 18% MC1 improvement over baseline LLaMA2-7B. Additionally, NL-ITI
performs better while being less invasive in the behavior of LLM at the same
time (as measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence).

                                        <span>  Evaluating the veracity of everyday claims is time consuming and in some
cases requires domain expertise. We empirically demonstrate that the commonly
used fact checking pipeline, known as the retriever-reader, suffers from
performance deterioration when it is trained on the labeled data from one
domain and used in another domain. Afterwards, we delve into each component of
the pipeline and propose novel algorithms to address this problem. We propose
an adversarial algorithm to make the retriever component robust against
distribution shift. Our core idea is to initially train a bi-encoder on the
labeled source data, and then, to adversarially train two separate document and
claim encoders using unlabeled target data. We then focus on the reader
component and propose to train it such that it is insensitive towards the order
of claims and evidence documents. Our empirical evaluations support the
hypothesis that such a reader shows a higher robustness against distribution
shift. To our knowledge, there is no publicly available multi-topic fact
checking dataset. Thus, we propose a simple automatic method to re-purpose two
well-known fact checking datasets. We then construct eight fact checking
scenarios from these datasets, and compare our model to a set of strong
baseline models, including recent domain adaptation models that use GPT4 for
generating synthetic data.

diversity in recommendation systems is both crucial and demanding. Many current
solutions leverage knowledge graphs to tackle these issues by combining both
item-based and user-item collaborative signals. A common trend in these
approaches focuses on improving ranking performance at the cost of escalating
model complexity, reducing diversity, and complicating the task. It is
essential to provide recommendations that are both personalized and diverse,
rather than solely relying on achieving high rank-based performance, such as
Click-through Rate, Recall, etc. In this paper, we propose a hybrid multi-task
learning approach, training on user-item and item-item interactions. We apply
item-based contrastive learning on descriptive text, sampling positive and
negative pairs based on item metadata. Our approach allows the model to better
understand the relationships between entities within the knowledge graph by
utilizing semantic information from text. It leads to more accurate, relevant,
and diverse user recommendations and a benefit that extends even to cold-start
users who have few interactions with items. We perform extensive experiments on
two widely used datasets to validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our
findings demonstrate that jointly training user-item interactions and
item-based signals using synopsis text is highly effective. Furthermore, our
results provide evidence that item-based contrastive learning enhances the
quality of entity embeddings, as indicated by metrics such as uniformity and
alignment.

Speculative Decoding with Semantic Adaptive Tokens (SDSAT). The primary
objective of this design is to enhance the LLM model's ability to generate
draft tokens more accurately without compromising the model's accuracy. The
core strategies involve: 1) Fine-tune the model by incorporating semantic
adaptive tokens that possess flexible decoding capabilities without changing
its structure, allowing them to generate high-quality draft tokens. 2) By
employing a training method that does not affect the standard tokens, the model
can acquire parallel decoding abilities atop its original framework with
minimal training overhead. 3) We have designed the "two-step-draft-then-verify"
generation strategies using both greedy search and nucleus sampling.
Experiments conducted on the CodeLlama-13B and 7B models have yielded speed
increases of over 3.5X and 3.0X, respectively. Please refer to

                                        <span>  In the context of the rising interest in code language models (code LMs) and
vulnerability detection, we study the effectiveness of code LMs for detecting
vulnerabilities. Our analysis reveals significant shortcomings in existing
vulnerability datasets, including poor data quality, low label accuracy, and
high duplication rates, leading to unreliable model performance in realistic
vulnerability detection scenarios. Additionally, the evaluation methods used
with these datasets are not representative of real-world vulnerability
detection.
  To address these challenges, we introduce PrimeVul, a new dataset for
training and evaluating code LMs for vulnerability detection. PrimeVul
incorporates a novel set of data labeling techniques that achieve comparable
label accuracy to human-verified benchmarks while significantly expanding the
dataset. It also implements a rigorous data de-duplication and chronological
data splitting strategy to mitigate data leakage issues, alongside introducing
more realistic evaluation metrics and settings. This comprehensive approach
aims to provide a more accurate assessment of code LMs' performance in
real-world conditions.
  Evaluating code LMs on PrimeVul reveals that existing benchmarks
significantly overestimate the performance of these models. For instance, a
state-of-the-art 7B model scored 68.26% F1 on BigVul but only 3.09% F1 on
PrimeVul. Attempts to improve performance through advanced training techniques
and larger models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 were unsuccessful, with results akin
to random guessing in the most stringent settings. These findings underscore
the considerable gap between current capabilities and the practical
requirements for deploying code LMs in security roles, highlighting the need
for more innovative research in this domain.

networks with certain brain-like properties. In the past few decades, this
model has received increasing attention in computer science community, owing
also to the successful phenomenon of deep learning. In SNN, communication
between neurons takes place through the spikes and spike trains. This
differentiates these models from the ``standard'' artificial neural networks
(ANN) where the frequency of spikes is replaced by real-valued signals. Spiking
neural P systems (SNPS) can be considered a branch of SNN based more on the
principles of formal automata, with many variants developed within the
framework of the membrane computing theory. In this paper, we first briefly
compare structure and function, advantages and drawbacks of SNN and SNPS. A key
part of the article is a survey of recent results and applications of machine
learning and deep learning models of both SNN and SNPS formalisms.

                                        <span>  Over the last years, various sentence embedders have been an integral part in
the success of current machine learning approaches to Natural Language
Processing (NLP). Unfortunately, multiple sources have shown that the bias,
inherent in the datasets upon which these embedding methods are trained, is
learned by them. A variety of different approaches to remove biases in
embeddings exists in the literature. Most of these approaches are applicable to
word embeddings and in fewer cases to sentence embeddings. It is problematic
that most debiasing approaches are directly transferred from word embeddings,
therefore these approaches fail to take into account the nonlinear nature of
sentence embedders and the embeddings they produce. It has been shown in
literature that bias information is still present if sentence embeddings are
debiased using such methods. In this contribution, we explore an approach to
remove linear and nonlinear bias information for NLP solutions, without
impacting downstream performance. We compare our approach to common debiasing
methods on classical bias metrics and on bias metrics which take nonlinear
information into account.

                                        <span>  In recent years, several influential computational models and metrics have
been proposed to predict how humans comprehend and process sentence. One
particularly promising approach is contextual semantic similarity. Inspired by
the attention algorithm in Transformer and human memory mechanisms, this study
proposes an ``attention-aware'' approach for computing contextual semantic
relevance. This new approach takes into account the different contributions of
contextual parts and the expectation effect, allowing it to incorporate
contextual information fully. The attention-aware approach also facilitates the
simulation of existing reading models and evaluate them. The resulting
``attention-aware'' metrics of semantic relevance can more accurately predict
fixation durations in Chinese reading tasks recorded in an eye-tracking corpus
than those calculated by existing approaches. The study's findings further
provide strong support for the presence of semantic preview benefits in Chinese
naturalistic reading. Furthermore, the attention-aware metrics of semantic
relevance, being memory-based, possess high interpretability from both
linguistic and cognitive standpoints, making them a valuable computational tool
for modeling eye-movements in reading and further gaining insight into the
process of language comprehension. Our approach underscores the potential of
these metrics to advance our comprehension of how humans understand and process
language, ultimately leading to a better understanding of language
comprehension and processing.

be achieved in one of two ways. It can be achieved either by imposing
constraints on AI actors such as developers, deployers and users, and on AI
resources such as data, or by imposing constraints on the range and scope of
the impact that AI agents can have on the environment. The latter approach
involves encoding extant rules concerning AI driven devices into the software
of AI agents controlling those devices (e.g., encoding rules about limitations
on zones of operations into the agent software of an autonomous drone device).
This is a challenge since the effectivity of such an approach requires a method
of extracting, loading, transforming and computing legal information that would
be both explainable and legally interoperable, and that would enable AI agents
to reason about the law. In this paper, we sketch a proof of principle for such
a method using large language models (LLMs), expert legal systems known as
legal decision paths, and Bayesian networks. We then show how the proposed
method could be applied to extant regulation in matters of autonomous cars,
such as the California Vehicle Code.

Out-of-Distribution (OoD) generalization under various types of distribution
shifts. Recent studies attempted to investigate the leading cause of this
capability. In this work, we follow the same path, but focus on a specific type
of OoD data - images with novel compositions of attribute-object pairs - and
study whether such models can successfully classify those images into
composition classes. We carefully designed an authentic image test dataset
called ImageNet-AO, consisting of attributes for objects that are unlikely
encountered in the CLIP training sets. We found that CLIPs trained with large
datasets such as OpenAI CLIP, LAION-400M, and LAION-2B show orders-of-magnitude
improvement in effective compositional OoD generalization compared to both
supervised models and CLIPs trained with smaller datasets, such as CC-12M and
YFCC-15M. Our results provide evidence that the scale and diversity of training
data and language supervision play a key role in unlocking the compositional
generalization abilities of vision-language models.

and generative performance. Inspired by the recent success of language
foundation models, in this paper, we propose LMTraj (Language-based Multimodal
Trajectory predictor), which recasts the trajectory prediction task into a sort
of question-answering problem. Departing from traditional numerical regression
models, which treat the trajectory coordinate sequence as continuous signals,
we consider them as discrete signals like text prompts. Specially, we first
transform an input space for the trajectory coordinate into the natural
language space. Here, the entire time-series trajectories of pedestrians are
converted into a text prompt, and scene images are described as text
information through image captioning. The transformed numerical and image data
are then wrapped into the question-answering template for use in a language
model. Next, to guide the language model in understanding and reasoning
high-level knowledge, such as scene context and social relationships between
pedestrians, we introduce an auxiliary multi-task question and answering. We
then train a numerical tokenizer with the prompt data. We encourage the
tokenizer to separate the integer and decimal parts well, and leverage it to
capture correlations between the consecutive numbers in the language model.
Lastly, we train the language model using the numerical tokenizer and all of
the question-answer prompts. Here, we propose a beam-search-based most-likely
prediction and a temperature-based multimodal prediction to implement both
deterministic and stochastic inferences. Applying our LMTraj, we show that the
language-based model can be a powerful pedestrian trajectory predictor, and
outperforms existing numerical-based predictor methods. Code is publicly

models for legal case retrieval. Most of the existing works focus on improving
the representation ability for the contextualized embedding of the [CLS] token
and calculate relevance using textual semantic similarity. However, in the
legal domain, textual semantic similarity does not always imply that the cases
are relevant enough. Instead, relevance in legal cases primarily depends on the
similarity of key facts that impact the final judgment. Without proper
treatments, the discriminative ability of learned representations could be
limited since legal cases are lengthy and contain numerous non-key facts. To
this end, we introduce DELTA, a discriminative model designed for legal case
retrieval. The basic idea involves pinpointing key facts in legal cases and
pulling the contextualized embedding of the [CLS] token closer to the key facts
while pushing away from the non-key facts, which can warm up the case embedding
space in an unsupervised manner. To be specific, this study brings the word
alignment mechanism to the contextual masked auto-encoder. First, we leverage
shallow decoders to create information bottlenecks, aiming to enhance the
representation ability. Second, we employ the deep decoder to enable
translation between different structures, with the goal of pinpointing key
facts to enhance discriminative ability. Comprehensive experiments conducted on
publicly available legal benchmarks show that our approach can outperform
existing state-of-the-art methods in legal case retrieval. It provides a new
perspective on the in-depth understanding and processing of legal case
documents.

While this approach has been successful in understanding genetic relations
between diverse languages, more analyses are needed to accurately quantify
their relatedness, especially in less studied linguistic levels such as syntax.
Here, we explore linguistic distances using series of parts of speech (POS)
extracted from the Universal Dependencies dataset. Within an
information-theoretic framework, we show that employing POS trigrams maximizes
the possibility of capturing syntactic variations while being at the same time
compatible with the amount of available data. Linguistic connections are then
established by assessing pairwise distances based on the POS distributions.
Intriguingly, our analysis reveals definite clusters that correspond to well
known language families and groups, with exceptions explained by distinct
morphological typologies. Furthermore, we obtain a significant correlation
between language similarity and geographic distance, which underscores the
influence of spatial proximity on language kinships.

                                        <span>  Nowadays, individuals tend to engage in dialogues with Large Language Models,
seeking answers to their questions. In times when such answers are readily
accessible to anyone, the stimulation and preservation of human's cognitive
abilities, as well as the assurance of maintaining good reasoning skills by
humans becomes crucial. This study addresses such needs by proposing hints
(instead of final answers or before giving answers) as a viable solution. We
introduce a framework for the automatic hint generation for factoid questions,
employing it to construct TriviaHG, a novel large-scale dataset featuring
160,230 hints corresponding to 16,645 questions from the TriviaQA dataset.
Additionally, we present an automatic evaluation method that measures the
Convergence and Familiarity quality attributes of hints. To evaluate the
TriviaHG dataset and the proposed evaluation method, we enlisted 10 individuals
to annotate 2,791 hints and tasked 6 humans with answering questions using the
provided hints. The effectiveness of hints varied, with success rates of 96%,
78%, and 36% for questions with easy, medium, and hard answers, respectively.
Moreover, the proposed automatic evaluation methods showed a robust correlation
with annotators' results. Conclusively, the findings highlight three key
insights: the facilitative role of hints in resolving unknown questions, the
dependence of hint quality on answer difficulty, and the feasibility of
employing automatic evaluation methods for hint assessment.

                                        <span>  Language models (LMs) are indispensable tools for natural language processing
tasks, but their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains a concern. While
current research has explored adversarial training techniques, their
improvements to defend against word-level attacks have been limited. In this
work, we propose a novel approach called Semantic Robust Defence (SemRoDe), a
Macro Adversarial Training strategy to enhance the robustness of LMs. Drawing
inspiration from recent studies in the image domain, we investigate and later
confirm that in a discrete data setting such as language, adversarial samples
generated via word substitutions do indeed belong to an adversarial domain
exhibiting a high Wasserstein distance from the base domain. Our method learns
a robust representation that bridges these two domains. We hypothesize that if
samples were not projected into an adversarial domain, but instead to a domain
with minimal shift, it would improve attack robustness. We align the domains by
incorporating a new distance-based objective. With this, our model is able to
learn more generalized representations by aligning the model's high-level
output features and therefore better handling unseen adversarial samples. This
method can be generalized across word embeddings, even when they share minimal
overlap at both vocabulary and word-substitution levels. To evaluate the
effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments on BERT and RoBERTa
models on three datasets. The results demonstrate promising state-of-the-art
robustness.

on a wide variety of biomedical NLP tasks. However, these models have hundreds
of billions of parameters, are computationally expensive to run, require users
to send their input data over the internet, and are trained on unknown data
sources. Can smaller, more targeted models compete? To address this question,
we build and release BioMedLM, a 2.7 billion parameter GPT-style autoregressive
model trained exclusively on PubMed abstracts and full articles. When
fine-tuned, BioMedLM can produce strong multiple-choice biomedical
question-answering results competitive with much larger models, such as
achieving a score of 57.3% on MedMCQA (dev) and 69.0% on the MMLU Medical
Genetics exam. BioMedLM can also be fine-tuned to produce useful answers to
patient questions on medical topics. This demonstrates that smaller models can
potentially serve as transparent, privacy-preserving, economical and
environmentally friendly foundations for particular NLP applications, such as
in biomedicine. The model is available on the Hugging Face Hub:

                                        <span>  Stimulated by the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of recent Large
Language Models (LLMs), a variety of strategies for bridging video modality
have been devised. A prominent strategy involves Video Language Models
(VideoLMs), which train a learnable interface with video data to connect
advanced vision encoders with LLMs. Recently, an alternative strategy has
surfaced, employing readily available foundation models, such as VideoLMs and
LLMs, across multiple stages for modality bridging. In this study, we introduce
a simple yet novel strategy where only a single Vision Language Model (VLM) is
utilized. Our starting point is the plain insight that a video comprises a
series of images, or frames, interwoven with temporal information. The essence
of video comprehension lies in adeptly managing the temporal aspects along with
the spatial details of each frame. Initially, we transform a video into a
single composite image by arranging multiple frames in a grid layout. The
resulting single image is termed as an image grid. This format, while
maintaining the appearance of a solitary image, effectively retains temporal
information within the grid structure. Therefore, the image grid approach
enables direct application of a single high-performance VLM without
necessitating any video-data training. Our extensive experimental analysis
across ten zero-shot video question answering benchmarks, including five
open-ended and five multiple-choice benchmarks, reveals that the proposed Image
Grid Vision Language Model (IG-VLM) surpasses the existing methods in nine out
of ten benchmarks.

processing, yet they face the challenge of generating unreliable content.
Recent works aim to reduce misinformation and hallucinations by resorting to
attribution as a means to provide evidence (i.e., citations). However, current
attribution methods usually focus on the retrieval stage and automatic
evaluation that neglect mirroring the citation mechanisms in human scholarly
writing to bolster credibility. In this paper, we address these challenges by
modelling the attribution task as preference learning and introducing an
Automatic Preference Optimization (APO) framework. First, we create a curated
collection for post-training with 6,330 examples by collecting and filtering
from existing datasets. Second, considering the high cost of labelling
preference data, we further propose an automatic method to synthesize
attribution preference data resulting in 95,263 pairs. Moreover, inspired by
the human citation process, we further propose a progressive preference
optimization method by leveraging fine-grained information. Extensive
experiments on three datasets (i.e., ASQA, StrategyQA, and ELI5) demonstrate
that APO achieves state-of-the-art citation F1 with higher answer quality.

of addressing a diverse range of tasks. However, general LLMs, which are
developed on open-domain data, may lack the domain-specific knowledge essential
for tasks in vertical domains, such as legal, medical, etc. To address this
issue, previous approaches either conduct continuous pre-training with
domain-specific data or employ retrieval augmentation to support general LLMs.
Unfortunately, these strategies are either cost-intensive or unreliable in
practical applications. To this end, we present a novel framework named BLADE,
which enhances Black-box LArge language models with small Domain-spEcific
models. BLADE consists of a black-box LLM and a small domain-specific LM. The
small LM preserves domain-specific knowledge and offers specialized insights,
while the general LLM contributes robust language comprehension and reasoning
capabilities. Specifically, our method involves three steps: 1) pre-training
the small LM with domain-specific data, 2) fine-tuning this model using
knowledge instruction data, and 3) joint Bayesian optimization of the general
LLM and the small LM. Extensive experiments conducted on public legal and
medical benchmarks reveal that BLADE significantly outperforms existing
approaches. This shows the potential of BLADE as an effective and
cost-efficient solution in adapting general LLMs for vertical domains.

forth the concept of semantic similarity, which has proven immensely beneficial
in multiple applications and has largely replaced keyword search. However,
evaluating semantic similarity and conducting searches for a specific query

due to the multifaceted nature of the task, the lack of standard benchmarks,

                                        <span>  Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate erroneous outputs, known as
hallucinations, due to their limitations in discerning questions beyond their
knowledge scope. While addressing hallucination has been a focal point in
research, previous efforts primarily concentrate on enhancing correctness
without giving due consideration to the significance of rejection mechanisms.
In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive examination of the role of rejection,
introducing the notion of model reliability along with corresponding metrics.
These metrics measure the model's ability to provide accurate responses while
adeptly rejecting questions exceeding its knowledge boundaries, thereby
minimizing hallucinations. To improve the inherent reliability of LLMs, we
present a novel alignment framework called Reinforcement Learning from
Knowledge Feedback (RLKF). RLKF leverages knowledge feedback to dynamically
determine the model's knowledge boundary and trains a reliable reward model to
encourage the refusal of out-of-knowledge questions. Experimental results on
mathematical questions affirm the substantial efficacy of RLKF in significantly
enhancing LLM reliability.

development of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Despite their impressive capabilities,
MLLMs often suffer from an over-reliance on unimodal biases (e.g., language
bias and vision bias), leading to incorrect answers in complex multimodal
tasks. To investigate this issue, we propose a causal framework to interpret
the biases in Visual Question Answering (VQA) problems. Within our framework,
we devise a causal graph to elucidate the predictions of MLLMs on VQA problems,
and assess the causal effect of biases through an in-depth causal analysis.
Motivated by the causal graph, we introduce a novel MORE dataset, consisting of
12,000 VQA instances. This dataset is designed to challenge MLLMs' abilities,
necessitating multi-hop reasoning and the surmounting of unimodal biases.
Furthermore, we propose two strategies to mitigate unimodal biases and enhance
MLLMs' reasoning capabilities, including a Decompose-Verify-Answer (DeVA)
framework for limited-access MLLMs and the refinement of open-source MLLMs
through fine-tuning. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments offer
valuable insights for future research.

with human values and societal norms to ensure their reliability and safety has
become crucial. Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) and
Constitutional AI (CAI) have been proposed for LLM alignment. However, these
methods require either heavy human annotations or explicitly pre-defined
constitutions, which are labor-intensive and resource-consuming. To overcome
these drawbacks, we study constitution-based LLM alignment and propose a
data-driven constitution discovery and self-alignment framework called
IterAlign. IterAlign leverages red teaming to unveil the weaknesses of an LLM
and automatically discovers new constitutions using a stronger LLM. These
constitutions are then used to guide self-correction of the base LLM. Such a
constitution discovery pipeline can be run iteratively and automatically to
discover new constitutions that specifically target the alignment gaps in the
current LLM. Empirical results on several safety benchmark datasets and
multiple base LLMs show that IterAlign successfully improves truthfulness,
helpfulness, harmlessness and honesty, improving the LLM alignment by up to
$13.5\%$ in harmlessness.

are then converted to formal syntax by a domain-expert leading to increased
design costs. This paper assesses the capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs) in converting between natural language descriptions and formal
specifications. Existing work has evaluated the capabilities of LLMs in
generating formal syntax such as source code but such experiments are typically
hand-crafted and use problems that are likely to be in the training set of
LLMs, and often require human-annotated datasets. We propose an approach that
can use two copies of an LLM in conjunction with an off-the-shelf verifier to
automatically evaluate its translation abilities without any additional human
input. Our approach generates formal syntax using language grammars to
automatically generate a dataset. We conduct an empirical evaluation to measure
the accuracy of this translation task and show that SOTA LLMs cannot adequately
solve this task, limiting their current utility in the design of complex
systems.

user-generated content on social media platforms, the pervasiveness of
offensive language, such as hate speech or cyberbullying, in the digital space
remains a significant challenge. Given the importance of maintaining a
civilized and respectful online environment, there is an urgent and growing
need for automatic systems capable of detecting offensive speech in real time.
However, developing effective systems for processing languages such as Chinese
presents a significant challenge, owing to the language's complex and nuanced
nature, which makes it difficult to process automatically. This paper provides
a comprehensive overview of offensive language detection in Chinese, examining
current benchmarks and approaches and highlighting specific models and tools
for addressing the unique challenges of detecting offensive language in this
complex language. The primary objective of this survey is to explore the
existing techniques and identify potential avenues for further research that
can address the cultural and linguistic complexities of Chinese.

language models (LLMs) utilizing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data for mathematical
reasoning tasks. Despite the fine-tuned LLMs, challenges persist, such as
incorrect, missing, and redundant steps in CoT generation leading to
inaccuracies in answer predictions. To alleviate this problem, we propose a
dual instruction tuning strategy to meticulously model mathematical reasoning
from both forward and reverse directions. This involves introducing the
Intermediate Reasoning State Prediction task (forward reasoning) and the
Instruction Reconstruction task (reverse reasoning) to enhance the LLMs'
understanding and execution of instructions. Training instances for these tasks
are constructed based on existing mathematical instruction tuning datasets.
Subsequently, LLMs undergo multi-task fine-tuning using both existing
mathematical instructions and the newly created data. Comprehensive experiments
validate the effectiveness and domain generalization of the dual instruction
tuning strategy across various mathematical reasoning tasks.

                                        <span>  Recent work has uncovered promising ways to extract well-calibrated
confidence estimates from language models (LMs), where the model's confidence
score reflects how likely it is to be correct. However, while LMs may appear
well-calibrated over broad distributions, this often hides significant
miscalibration within narrower slices (e.g., systemic over-confidence in math
can balance out systemic under-confidence in history, yielding perfect
calibration in aggregate). To attain well-calibrated confidence estimates for
any slice of a distribution, we propose a new framework for few-shot
slice-specific recalibration. Specifically, we train a recalibration model that
takes in a few unlabeled examples from any given slice and predicts a curve
that remaps confidence scores to be more accurate for that slice. Our trained
model can recalibrate for arbitrary new slices, without using any labeled data
from that slice. This enables us to identify domain-specific confidence
thresholds above which the LM's predictions can be trusted, and below which it
should abstain. Experiments show that our few-shot recalibrator consistently
outperforms existing calibration methods, for instance improving calibration
error for PaLM2-Large on MMLU by 16%, as compared to temperature scaling.

presumption that each utterance represents a single intent. However, this
assumption may not accurately reflect real-world situations, where users
frequently express multiple intents within a single utterance. While there is
an emerging interest in multi-intent detection (MID), existing in-domain
datasets such as MixATIS and MixSNIPS have limitations in their formulation. To
address these issues, we present BlendX, a suite of refined datasets featuring
more diverse patterns than their predecessors, elevating both its complexity
and diversity. For dataset construction, we utilize both rule-based heuristics
as well as a generative tool -- OpenAI's ChatGPT -- which is augmented with a
similarity-driven strategy for utterance selection. To ensure the quality of
the proposed datasets, we also introduce three novel metrics that assess the
statistical properties of an utterance related to word count, conjunction use,
and pronoun usage. Extensive experiments on BlendX reveal that state-of-the-art
MID models struggle with the challenges posed by the new datasets, highlighting
the need to reexamine the current state of the MID field. The dataset is

                                        <span>  Transformer structure has achieved great success in multiple applied machine
learning communities, such as natural language processing (NLP), computer
vision (CV) and information retrieval (IR). Transformer architecture's core
mechanism -- attention requires $O(n^2)$ time complexity in training and $O(n)$
time complexity in inference. Many works have been proposed to improve the
attention mechanism's scalability, such as Flash Attention and Multi-query
Attention. A different line of work aims to design new mechanisms to replace
attention. Recently, a notable model structure -- Mamba, which is based on
state space models, has achieved transformer-equivalent performance in multiple
sequence modeling tasks.
  In this work, we examine \mamba's efficacy through the lens of a classical IR
task -- document ranking. A reranker model takes a query and a document as
input, and predicts a scalar relevance score. This task demands the language
model's ability to comprehend lengthy contextual inputs and to capture the
interaction between query and document tokens. We find that (1) Mamba models
achieve competitive performance compared to transformer-based models with the
same training recipe; (2) but also have a lower training throughput in
comparison to efficient transformer implementations such as flash attention. We
hope this study can serve as a starting point to explore Mamba models in other
classical IR tasks. Our code implementation and trained checkpoints are made
public to facilitate
reproducibility.\footnote{https://github.com/zhichaoxu-shufe/RankMamba}.

                                        <span>  Recent Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models have demonstrated
significant advancements. Nevertheless, these models heavily rely on image-text
pairs that capture only coarse and global information of an image, leading to a
limitation in their regional understanding ability. In this work, we introduce
\textbf{RegionVLM}, equipped with explicit regional modeling capabilities,
allowing them to understand user-indicated image regions. To achieve this, we
design a simple yet innovative architecture, requiring no modifications to the
model architecture or objective function. Additionally, we leverage a dataset
that contains a novel source of information, namely Localized Narratives, which
has been overlooked in previous VLP research. Our experiments demonstrate that
our single generalist model not only achieves an interactive dialogue system
but also exhibits superior performance on various zero-shot region
understanding tasks, without compromising its ability for global image
understanding.

                                        <span>  Metaphors are ubiquitous in daily life, yet detecting them poses a
significant challenge. Previous approaches often struggled with improper
application of language rules and overlooked the issue of data sparsity. To
address these challenges, we introduce knowledge distillation and prompt
learning into metaphor detection. Specifically, we devise a prompt learning
template tailored for the metaphor detection task. By masking target words and
providing relevant prompt information, we guide the model to accurately infer
the contextual meaning of these words. This approach not only mitigates the
interference from the literal meaning of target words but also ensures the
proper utilization of MIP language rules for metaphor detection. Moreover, we
employ a teacher model equipped with prior knowledge to generate meaningful
soft labels, guiding the optimization process of the student model. The
inclusion of soft labels, akin to label smoothing, helps alleviate the model's
tendency towards over-confidence and effectively addresses the challenge of
data sparsity. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model
achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets.

                                        <span>  Visual representation learning has been a cornerstone in computer vision,
evolving from supervised learning with human-annotated labels to aligning
image-text pairs from the Internet. Despite recent advancements in multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs), the visual representations they rely on, such as
CLIP embeddings, often lack access to external world knowledge critical for
real-world visual reasoning. In this work, we propose Visual Table, a novel
visual representation tailored for MLLMs. It provides hierarchical text
descriptions of holistic visual scenes, consisting of a scene description and
multiple object-centric descriptions that encompass categories, attributes, and
knowledge at instance level. We further develop a scalable generator for visual
table generation and train it on small-scale annotations from GPT4V. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that, with generated visual tables as additional visual
representations, our model can consistently outperform the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) MLLMs across diverse benchmarks. When visual tables serve as standalone
visual representations, our model can closely match or even beat the SOTA MLLMs
that are built on CLIP visual embeddings. Our code is available at

provide evidence that text-based models fail to create meaningful

                                        <span>  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the creation
of fake news, particularly in complex fields like healthcare. Studies highlight
the gap in the deceptive power of LLM-generated fake news with and without
human assistance, yet the potential of prompting techniques has not been fully
explored. Thus, this work aims to determine whether prompting strategies can
effectively narrow this gap. Current LLM-based fake news attacks require human
intervention for information gathering and often miss details and fail to
maintain context consistency. Therefore, to better understand threat tactics,
we propose a strong fake news attack method called conditional
Variational-autoencoder-Like Prompt (VLPrompt). Unlike current methods,
VLPrompt eliminates the need for additional data collection while maintaining
contextual coherence and preserving the intricacies of the original text. To
propel future research on detecting VLPrompt attacks, we created a new dataset
named VLPrompt fake news (VLPFN) containing real and fake texts. Our
experiments, including various detection methods and novel human study metrics,
were conducted to assess their performance on our dataset, yielding numerous
findings.

hallucinations that misalign with world knowledge. Despite extensive efforts to
detect and mitigate hallucinations, understanding their internal mechanisms
remains elusive. Our study investigates the mechanistic causes of
hallucination, specifically non-factual ones where the LM incorrectly predicts
object attributes in response to subject-relation queries. With causal
mediation analysis and embedding space projection, we identify two general
mechanistic causes of hallucinations shared across LMs of various scales and
designs: 1) insufficient subject attribute knowledge in lower layer MLPs, and
2) failing to select the correct object attribute in upper layer attention
heads and MLPs. These two mechanisms exhibit varying degrees of subject-object
association, predictive uncertainty and perturbation robustness. Additionally,
we scrutinize LM pre-training checkpoints, revealing distinct learning dynamics
for the two mechanistic causes of hallucinations. We also highlight how
attribution features from our causal analysis can effectively construct
hallucination detectors. Our work proposes a mechanistic understanding of LM
factual errors.

                                        <span>  Large Language Models exhibit robust problem-solving capabilities for diverse
tasks. However, most LLM-based agents are designed as specific task solvers
with sophisticated prompt engineering, rather than agents capable of learning
and evolving through interactions. These task solvers necessitate manually
crafted prompts to inform task rules and regulate LLM behaviors, inherently
incapacitating to address complex dynamic scenarios e.g., large interactive
games. In light of this, we propose Agent-Pro: an LLM-based Agent with
Policy-level Reflection and Optimization that can learn a wealth of expertise
from interactive experiences and progressively elevate its behavioral policy.
Specifically, it involves a dynamic belief generation and reflection process
for policy evolution. Rather than action-level reflection, Agent-Pro
iteratively reflects on past trajectories and beliefs, fine-tuning its
irrational beliefs for a better policy. Moreover, a depth-first search is
employed for policy optimization, ensuring continual enhancement in policy
payoffs. Agent-Pro is evaluated across two games: Blackjack and Texas Hold'em,
outperforming vanilla LLM and specialized models. Our results show Agent-Pro
can learn and evolve in complex and dynamic scenes, which also benefits
numerous LLM-based applications.

                                        <span>  The reflection capacity of Large Language Model (LLM) has garnered extensive
attention. A post-hoc prompting strategy, e.g., reflexion and self-refine,
refines LLM's response based on self-evaluated or external feedback. However,
recent research indicates without external feedback, LLM's intrinsic reflection
is unstable. Our investigation unveils that the key bottleneck is the quality
of the self-evaluated feedback. We find LLMs often exhibit overconfidence or
high randomness when self-evaluate, offering stubborn or inconsistent feedback,
which causes poor reflection. To remedy this, we advocate Self-Contrast: It
adaptively explores diverse solving perspectives tailored to the request,
contrasts the differences, and summarizes these discrepancies into a checklist
which could be used to re-examine and eliminate discrepancies. Our method
endows LLM with diverse perspectives to alleviate stubborn biases. Moreover,
their discrepancies indicate potential errors or inherent uncertainties that
LLM often overlooks. Reflecting upon these can catalyze more accurate and
stable reflection. Experiments conducted on a series of reasoning and
translation tasks with different LLMs serve to underscore the effectiveness and
generality of our strategy.

significant progress, they still fall short in speech quality, similarity, and
prosody. Considering speech intricately encompasses various attributes (e.g.,
content, prosody, timbre, and acoustic details) that pose significant
challenges for generation, a natural idea is to factorize speech into
individual subspaces representing different attributes and generate them
individually. Motivated by it, we propose NaturalSpeech 3, a TTS system with
novel factorized diffusion models to generate natural speech in a zero-shot
way. Specifically, 1) we design a neural codec with factorized vector
quantization (FVQ) to disentangle speech waveform into subspaces of content,
prosody, timbre, and acoustic details; 2) we propose a factorized diffusion
model to generate attributes in each subspace following its corresponding
prompt. With this factorization design, NaturalSpeech 3 can effectively and
efficiently model intricate speech with disentangled subspaces in a
divide-and-conquer way. Experiments show that NaturalSpeech 3 outperforms the
state-of-the-art TTS systems on quality, similarity, prosody, and
intelligibility, and achieves on-par quality with human recordings.
Furthermore, we achieve better performance by scaling to 1B parameters and 200K
hours of training data.

effectively, it has gained a huge popularity amongst research as well as
industrial community. Recently, many studies have been published to show the
effectiveness, efficiency, integration, and sentiments of chatGPT and other

suggests that not only chatGPT but every subsequent entry in the category of
conversational bots should undergo Sustainability, PrivAcy, Digital divide, and

concerns raised over chatGPT in line with aforementioned characteristics. We
also discuss the recent EU AI Act briefly in accordance with the SPADE

utilize tools, especially through API calls, has advanced notably. This
progress has necessitated more accurate evaluation methods. Many existing
studies adopt static evaluation, where they assess AI assistants' API call
based on pre-defined dialogue histories. However, such evaluation method can be
misleading, as an AI assistant might fail in generating API calls from
preceding human interaction in real cases. Instead of the resource-intensive
method of direct human-machine interactions, we propose Automated Dynamic
Evaluation (AutoDE) to assess an assistant's API call capability without human
involvement. In our framework, we endeavor to closely mirror genuine human
conversation patterns in human-machine interactions, using a LLM-based user
agent, equipped with a user script to ensure human alignment. Experimental
results highlight that AutoDE uncovers errors overlooked by static evaluations,
aligning more closely with human assessment. Testing four AI assistants using
our crafted benchmark, our method further mirrored human evaluation compared to
conventional static evaluations.

biographical information in the context of digital humanities and related
subjects. There is a growing interest in the community to build datasets
capable of training machine learning models to extract relationships. However,
annotating such datasets can be expensive and time-consuming, in addition to
being limited to English. This paper applies guided distant supervision to
create a large biographical relationship extraction dataset for German. Our
dataset, composed of more than 80,000 instances for nine relationship types, is
the largest biographical German relationship extraction dataset. We also create
a manually annotated dataset with 2000 instances to evaluate the models and
release it together with the dataset compiled using guided distant supervision.
We train several state-of-the-art machine learning models on the automatically
created dataset and release them as well. Furthermore, we experiment with
multilingual and cross-lingual experiments that could benefit many low-resource
languages.

system identification. GlotScript-R is a resource that provides the attested
writing systems for more than 7,000 languages. It is compiled by aggregating
information from existing writing system resources. GlotScript-T is a writing
system identification tool that covers all 161 Unicode 15.0 scripts. For an
input text, it returns its script distribution where scripts are identified by
ISO 15924 codes. We also present two use cases for GlotScript. First, we
demonstrate that GlotScript can help cleaning multilingual corpora such as mC4
and OSCAR. Second, we analyze the tokenization of a number of language models
such as GPT-4 using GlotScript and provide insights on the coverage of low
resource scripts and languages by each language model. We hope that GlotScript
will become a useful resource for work on low resource languages in the NLP
community. GlotScript-R and GlotScript-T are available at

                                        <span>  With the advancements of transformer-based architectures, we observe the rise
of natural language preprocessing (NLPre) tools capable of solving preliminary
NLP tasks (e.g. tokenisation, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, or
morphological analysis) without any external linguistic guidance. It is arduous
to compare novel solutions to well-entrenched preprocessing toolkits, relying
on rule-based morphological analysers or dictionaries. Aware of the
shortcomings of existing NLPre evaluation approaches, we investigate a novel
method of reliable and fair evaluation and performance reporting. Inspired by
the GLUE benchmark, the proposed language-centric benchmarking system enables
comprehensive ongoing evaluation of multiple NLPre tools, while credibly
tracking their performance. The prototype application is configured for Polish
and integrated with the thoroughly assembled NLPre-PL benchmark. Based on this
benchmark, we conduct an extensive evaluation of a variety of Polish NLPre
systems. To facilitate the construction of benchmarking environments for other
languages, e.g. NLPre-GA for Irish or NLPre-ZH for Chinese, we ensure full
customization of the publicly released source code of the benchmarking system.

                                        <span>  Generating accurate Structured Querying Language (SQL) is a long-standing
problem, especially in matching users' semantic queries with structured
databases and then generating structured SQL. Existing models typically input
queries and database schemas into the LLM and rely on the LLM to perform
semantic-structure matching and generate structured SQL. However, such
solutions overlook the structural information within user queries and
databases, which can be utilized to enhance the generation of structured SQL.
This oversight can lead to inaccurate or unexecutable SQL generation. To fully
exploit the structure, we propose a structure-to-SQL framework, which leverages
the inherent structure information to improve the SQL generation of LLMs.
Specifically, we introduce our Structure Guided SQL~(SGU-SQL) generation model.
SGU-SQL first links user queries and databases in a structure-enhanced manner.
It then decomposes complicated linked structures with grammar trees to guide
the LLM to generate the SQL step by step. Extensive experiments on two
benchmark datasets illustrate that SGU-SQL can outperform sixteen SQL
generation baselines.

often being unable to retrieve documents relevant to the user's query. We
address this challenge by proposing a lightweight abstention mechanism tailored

extraction, consisting of two subtasks: named entity recognition and relation
extraction. However, most existing joint extraction methods suffer from issues
of feature confusion or inadequate interaction between the two subtasks.
Addressing these challenges, in this work, we propose a Co-Attention network
for joint entity and Relation Extraction (CARE). Our approach includes adopting
a parallel encoding strategy to learn separate representations for each
subtask, aiming to avoid feature overlap or confusion. At the core of our
approach is the co-attention module that captures two-way interaction between
the two subtasks, allowing the model to leverage entity information for
relation prediction and vice versa, thus promoting mutual enhancement. Through
extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets for joint entity and relation
extraction (NYT, WebNLG, and SciERC), we demonstrate that our proposed model
outperforms existing baseline models. Our code will be available at

problem have relied on supervised methods by training on corpora of confirmed
human- and machine- written documents. Unfortunately, model under-specification
poses an unavoidable challenge for neural network-based detectors, making them
brittle in the face of data shifts, such as the release of newer language
models producing still more fluent text than the models used to train the
detectors. Other approaches require access to the models that may have
generated a document in question, which is often impractical. In light of these
challenges, we pursue a fundamentally different approach not relying on samples
from language models of concern at training time. Instead, we propose to
leverage representations of writing style estimated from human-authored text.
Indeed, we find that features effective at distinguishing among human authors
are also effective at distinguishing human from machine authors, including
state-of-the-art large language models like Llama-2, ChatGPT, and GPT-4.
Furthermore, given a handful of examples composed by each of several specific
language models of interest, our approach affords the ability to predict which
model generated a given document. The code and data to reproduce our
experiments are available at

provide useful and safe responses. However, adversarial prompts known as
'jailbreaks' can circumvent safeguards, leading LLMs to generate potentially
harmful content. Exploring jailbreak prompts can help to better reveal the
weaknesses of LLMs and further steer us to secure them. Unfortunately, existing
jailbreak methods either suffer from intricate manual design or require
optimization on other white-box models, which compromises either generalization
or efficiency. In this paper, we generalize jailbreak prompt attacks into two
aspects: (1) Prompt Rewriting and (2) Scenario Nesting. Based on this, we
propose ReNeLLM, an automatic framework that leverages LLMs themselves to
generate effective jailbreak prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ReNeLLM significantly improves the attack success rate while greatly reducing
the time cost compared to existing baselines. Our study also reveals the
inadequacy of current defense methods in safeguarding LLMs. Finally, we analyze
the failure of LLMs defense from the perspective of prompt execution priority,
and propose corresponding defense strategies. We hope that our research can
catalyze both the academic community and LLMs developers towards the provision
of safer and more regulated LLMs. The code is available at

visual document understanding (VDU), which typically requires models to gain
abilities to perceive and reason both document texts and layouts (e.g.,
locations of texts and table-cells). To this end, we propose visually guided
generative text-layout pre-training, named ViTLP. Given a document image, the
model optimizes hierarchical language and layout modeling objectives to
generate the interleaved text and layout sequence. In addition, to address the
limitation of processing long documents by Transformers, we introduce a
straightforward yet effective multi-segment generative pre-training scheme,
facilitating ViTLP to process word-intensive documents of any length. ViTLP can
function as a native OCR model to localize and recognize texts of document
images. Besides, ViTLP can be effectively applied to various downstream VDU
tasks. Extensive experiments show that ViTLP achieves competitive performance
over existing baselines on benchmark VDU tasks, including information
extraction, document classification, and document question answering.

                                        <span>  Prompt-based learning is a new language model training paradigm that adapts
the Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to downstream tasks, which revitalizes
the performance benchmarks across various natural language processing (NLP)
tasks. Instead of using a fixed prompt template to fine-tune the model, some
research demonstrates the effectiveness of searching for the prompt via
optimization. Such prompt optimization process of prompt-based learning on PLMs
also gives insight into generating adversarial prompts to mislead the model,
raising concerns about the adversarial vulnerability of this paradigm. Recent
studies have shown that universal adversarial triggers (UATs) can be generated
to alter not only the predictions of the target PLMs but also the prediction of
corresponding Prompt-based Fine-tuning Models (PFMs) under the prompt-based
learning paradigm. However, UATs found in previous works are often unreadable
tokens or characters and can be easily distinguished from natural texts with
adaptive defenses. In this work, we consider the naturalness of the UATs and
develop $\textit{LinkPrompt}$, an adversarial attack algorithm to generate UATs
by a gradient-based beam search algorithm that not only effectively attacks the
target PLMs and PFMs but also maintains the naturalness among the trigger
tokens. Extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of
$\textit{LinkPrompt}$, as well as the transferability of UATs generated by
$\textit{LinkPrompt}$ to open-sourced Large Language Model (LLM) Llama2 and
API-accessed LLM GPT-3.5-turbo.

                                        <span>  Verifiable generation aims to let the large language model (LLM) generate
text with supporting documents, which enables the user to flexibly verify the
answer and makes the LLM's output more reliable. Retrieval plays a crucial role
in verifiable generation. Specifically, the retrieved documents not only
supplement knowledge to help the LLM generate correct answers, but also serve
as supporting evidence for the user to verify the LLM's output. However, the
widely used retrievers become the bottleneck of the entire pipeline and limit
the overall performance. Their capabilities are usually inferior to LLMs since
they often have much fewer parameters than the large language model and have
not been demonstrated to scale well to the size of LLMs. If the retriever does
not correctly find the supporting documents, the LLM can not generate the
correct and verifiable answer, which overshadows the LLM's remarkable
abilities. To address these limitations, we propose \LLatrieval (Large Language
Model Verified Retrieval), where the LLM updates the retrieval result until it
verifies that the retrieved documents can sufficiently support answering the
question. Thus, the LLM can iteratively provide feedback to retrieval and
facilitate the retrieval result to fully support verifiable generation.
Experiments show that LLatrieval significantly outperforms extensive baselines
and achieves state-of-the-art results.

analysis by revealing aligned latent topics. However, most existing methods
suffer from producing repetitive topics that hinder further analysis and
performance decline caused by low-coverage dictionaries. In this paper, we
propose the Cross-lingual Topic Modeling with Mutual Information (InfoCTM).
Instead of the direct alignment in previous work, we propose a topic alignment
with mutual information method. This works as a regularization to properly
align topics and prevent degenerate topic representations of words, which
mitigates the repetitive topic issue. To address the low-coverage dictionary
issue, we further propose a cross-lingual vocabulary linking method that finds
more linked cross-lingual words for topic alignment beyond the translations of
a given dictionary. Extensive experiments on English, Chinese, and Japanese
datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
producing more coherent, diverse, and well-aligned topics and showing better
transferability for cross-lingual classification tasks.

                                        <span>  The widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs), celebrated for their
ability to generate human-like text, has raised concerns about misinformation
and ethical implications. Addressing these concerns necessitates the
development of robust methods to detect and attribute text generated by LLMs.
This paper investigates "Cross-Model Detection," by evaluating whether a
classifier trained to distinguish between source LLM-generated and
human-written text can also detect text from a target LLM without further
training. The study comprehensively explores various LLM sizes and families,
and assesses the impact of conversational fine-tuning techniques, quantization,
and watermarking on classifier generalization. The research also explores Model
Attribution, encompassing source model identification, model family, and model
size classification, in addition to quantization and watermarking detection.
Our results reveal several key findings: a clear inverse relationship between
classifier effectiveness and model size, with larger LLMs being more
challenging to detect, especially when the classifier is trained on data from
smaller models. Training on data from similarly sized LLMs can improve
detection performance from larger models but may lead to decreased performance
when dealing with smaller models. Additionally, model attribution experiments
show promising results in identifying source models and model families,
highlighting detectable signatures in LLM-generated text, with particularly
remarkable outcomes in watermarking detection, while no detectable signatures
of quantization were observed. Overall, our study contributes valuable insights
into the interplay of model size, family, and training data in LLM detection
and attribution.

                                        <span>  To help the open-source community have a better understanding of
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) based large language models (LLMs), we train and
release OpenMoE, a series of fully open-sourced and reproducible decoder-only
MoE LLMs, ranging from 650M to 34B parameters and trained on up to over 1T
tokens. Our investigation confirms that MoE-based LLMs can offer a more
favorable cost-effectiveness trade-off than dense LLMs, highlighting the
potential effectiveness for future LLM development.
  One more important contribution of this study is an in-depth analysis of the
routing mechanisms within our OpenMoE models, leading to three significant
findings: Context-Independent Specialization, Early Routing Learning, and
Drop-towards-the-End. We discovered that routing decisions in MoE models are
predominantly based on token IDs, with minimal context relevance. The
token-to-expert assignments are determined early in the pre-training phase and
remain largely unchanged. This imperfect routing can result in performance
degradation, particularly in sequential tasks like multi-turn conversations,
where tokens appearing later in a sequence are more likely to be dropped.
Finally, we rethink our design based on the above-mentioned observations and
analysis. To facilitate future MoE LLM development, we propose potential
strategies for mitigating the issues we found and further improving
off-the-shelf MoE LLM designs.

                                        <span>  The large success of deep learning based methods in Visual Question Answering
(VQA) has concurrently increased the demand for explainable methods. Most
methods in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) focus on generating
post-hoc explanations rather than taking an intrinsic approach, the latter
characterizing an interpretable model. In this work, we introduce an
interpretable approach for graph-based VQA and demonstrate competitive
performance on the GQA dataset. This approach bridges the gap between
interpretability and performance. Our model is designed to intrinsically
produce a subgraph during the question-answering process as its explanation,
providing insight into the decision making. To evaluate the quality of these
generated subgraphs, we compare them against established post-hoc
explainability methods for graph neural networks, and perform a human
evaluation. Moreover, we present quantitative metrics that correlate with the
evaluations of human assessors, acting as automatic metrics for the generated
explanatory subgraphs. Our implementation is available at

challenges like hallucination, outdated knowledge, and non-transparent,
untraceable reasoning processes. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has
emerged as a promising solution by incorporating knowledge from external
databases. This enhances the accuracy and credibility of the generation,
particularly for knowledge-intensive tasks, and allows for continuous knowledge
updates and integration of domain-specific information. RAG synergistically
merges LLMs' intrinsic knowledge with the vast, dynamic repositories of
external databases. This comprehensive review paper offers a detailed
examination of the progression of RAG paradigms, encompassing the Naive RAG,
the Advanced RAG, and the Modular RAG. It meticulously scrutinizes the
tripartite foundation of RAG frameworks, which includes the retrieval, the
generation and the augmentation techniques. The paper highlights the
state-of-the-art technologies embedded in each of these critical components,
providing a profound understanding of the advancements in RAG systems.
Furthermore, this paper introduces up-to-date evaluation framework and
benchmark. At the end, this article delineates the challenges currently faced
and points out prospective avenues for research and development.

straightforward, and effective technique for masking image patches during
pre-training of a vision-language model. GLIP builds on Fast Language-Image
Pre-Training (FLIP), which randomly masks image patches while training a CLIP
model. GLIP replaces random masking with centered masking, that uses a Gaussian
distribution and is inspired by the importance of image patches at the center
of the image. GLIP retains the same computational savings as FLIP, while
improving performance across a range of downstream datasets and tasks, as
demonstrated by our experimental results. We show the benefits of GLIP to be
easy to obtain, requiring no delicate tuning of the Gaussian, and also
applicable to data sets containing images without an obvious center focus.

of the respective language representation spaces produced by MLLMs. We place a
specific emphasis on the role of linguistic characteristics and investigate
their inter-correlation with the impact on representation spaces and
cross-lingual transfer performance. Additionally, this paper provides
preliminary evidence of how these findings can be leveraged to enhance transfer
to linguistically distant languages.

the realm of large multimodal models (LMMs), which incorporate multiple types
of data beyond text. However, the nature of multimodal models leads to
significant expenses in the creation of training data. Furthermore,
constructing multilingual data for LMMs presents its own set of challenges due
to language diversity and complexity. Therefore, in this study, we propose two
cost-effective methods to solve this problem: (1) vocabulary expansion and
pretraining of multilingual LLM for specific languages, and (2) automatic and
elaborate construction of multimodal datasets using GPT4-V. Based on015 these
methods, we constructed a 91K English-Korean-Chinese multilingual, multimodal
training dataset. Additionally, we developed a bilingual multimodal model that
exhibits excellent performance in both Korean and English, surpassing existing
approaches.

table-to-text generation tasks. However, the lack of domain-specific knowledge
makes it challenging to bridge the topological gap between tabular data and
text, especially in real-world applications with limited resources. To mitigate
the limitation of insufficient labeled data, we propose a novel framework:
Adapt-Knowledge-to-Generate (AKG). The core insight of AKG is to adapt
unlabeled domain-specific knowledge into the model, which brings at least three
benefits: (1) it injects representation of normal table-related descriptions to
bridge the topological gap between tabular data and texts; (2) it enables us to
use large amounts of unlabeled domain-specific knowledge fully, which can
alleviate the PLMs' inherent shortcomings of lacking domain knowledge; (3) it
allows us to design various tasks to employ the domain-specific knowledge.
Extensive experiments and analyses are conducted on three open-domain, few-shot
natural language generation (NLG) data sets: Humans, Songs, and Books. Compared
to previous state-of-the-art approaches, our model achieves superior
performance in terms of both fluency and accuracy as judged by human and
automatic evaluations.

                                        <span>  To address intricate real-world tasks, there has been a rising interest in
tool utilization in applications of large language models (LLMs). To develop
LLM-based agents, it usually requires LLMs to understand many tool functions
from different tool documentation. But these documentations could be diverse,
redundant or incomplete, which immensely affects the capability of LLMs in
using tools. To solve this, we introduce EASYTOOL, a framework transforming
diverse and lengthy tool documentation into a unified and concise tool
instruction for easier tool usage. EasyTool purifies essential information from
extensive tool documentation of different sources, and elaborates a unified
interface (i.e., tool instruction) to offer standardized tool descriptions and
functionalities for LLM-based agents. Extensive experiments on multiple
different tasks demonstrate that EasyTool can significantly reduce token
consumption and improve the performance of tool utilization in real-world
scenarios. Our code will be available at

diverse tasks in underrepresented languages using only short in-context
information, offering a crucial avenue for narrowing the gap between
high-resource and low-resource languages. Nonetheless, there is only a handful
of works explored ICL for low-resource languages with most of them focusing on
relatively high-resource languages, such as French and Spanish. In this work,
we extensively study ICL and its cross-lingual variation (X-ICL) on 25
low-resource and 7 relatively higher-resource languages. Our study not only
assesses the effectiveness of ICL with LLMs in low-resource languages but also
identifies the shortcomings of in-context label alignment, and introduces a
more effective alternative: query alignment. Moreover, we provide valuable
insights into various facets of ICL for low-resource languages. Our study
concludes the significance of few-shot in-context information on enhancing the
low-resource understanding quality of LLMs through semantically relevant
information by closing the language gap in the target language and aligning the
semantics between the targeted low-resource and the high-resource language that
the model is proficient in. Our work highlights the importance of advancing ICL
research, particularly for low-resource languages.

directions. For a speaker, responding passively or leading proactively would
result in rather different responses. However, most dialogue systems focus on
training a holistic response generation model without any distinction among
different initiatives. It leads to the cross-contamination problem, where the
model confuses different initiatives and generates inappropriate responses.
Moreover, obtaining plenty of human annotations for initiative labels can be
expensive. To address this issue, we propose a general mix-Initiative Dynamic
Prefix Tuning framework (IDPT) to decouple different initiatives from the
generation model, which learns initiative-aware prefixes in both supervised and
unsupervised settings. Specifically, IDPT decouples initiative factors into
different prefix parameters and uses the attention mechanism to adjust the
selection of initiatives in guiding generation dynamically. The prefix
parameters can be tuned towards accurate initiative prediction as well as
mix-initiative response generation. Extensive experiments on two public
dialogue datasets show that the proposed IDPT outperforms previous baselines on
both automatic metrics and human evaluations. It also manages to generate
appropriate responses with manipulated initiatives.

downstream NLP tasks. However, pre-training large language models demands
substantial memory and training compute. Furthermore, due to the substantial
resources required, many PLM weights are confidential. Consequently, users are
compelled to share their data with model owners for fine-tuning specific tasks.
To overcome the limitations, we introduce Plug-in External Memory Adaptation
(PEMA), a Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method, enabling PLM
fine-tuning without requiring access to all the weights. PEMA integrates with
context representations from test data during inference to perform downstream
tasks. It uses external memory to store PLM-generated context representations
mapped with target tokens. Our method utilizes weight matrices of LoRA-like
bottlenecked adapter in the PLM's final layer to enhance efficiency. Our
approach also includes Gradual Unrolling, a novel interpolation strategy to
improve generation quality. We validate PEMA's effectiveness through
experiments on syntactic and real datasets for machine translation and style
transfer. Our findings show that PEMA outperforms other PEFT approaches in
memory and latency efficiency for training, and also excels in maintaining
sentence meaning and generating appropriate language and styles.

                                        <span>  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated efficacy in various linguistic
applications, including text summarization and controlled text generation.
However, studies into their capacity of switching between styles via
fine-tuning remain underexplored. This study concentrates on textual
professionalism and introduces a novel methodology, named ProSwitch, which
equips a language model with the ability to produce both professional and
non-professional responses through knowledge-guided instruction tuning.
ProSwitch unfolds across three phases: data preparation for gathering domain
knowledge and training corpus; instruction tuning for optimizing language
models with multiple levels of instruction formats; and comprehensive
evaluation for assessing the professionalism discrimination and reference-based
quality of generated text. Comparative analysis of ProSwitch against both
general and specialized language models reveals that our approach outperforms
baselines in switching between professional and non-professional text
generation.

                                        <span>  Post-training quantization (PTQ) has played a key role in compressing large
language models (LLMs) with ultra-low costs. However, existing PTQ methods only
focus on handling the outliers within one layer or one block, which ignores the
dependency of blocks and leads to severe performance degradation in low-bit
settings. In this paper, we propose CBQ, a cross-block reconstruction-based PTQ
method for LLMs. CBQ employs a cross-block dependency using a homologous
reconstruction scheme, establishing long-range dependencies across multiple
blocks to minimize error accumulation. Furthermore, CBQ incorporates a
coarse-to-fine preprocessing (CFP) strategy for suppressing weight and
activation outliers, coupled with an adaptive LoRA-Rounding technique for
precise weight quantization. These innovations enable CBQ to not only handle
extreme outliers effectively but also improve overall quantization accuracy.
Extensive experiments show that CBQ achieves superior low-bit quantization
(W4A4, W4A8, W2A16) and outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across
various LLMs and datasets. Notably, CBQ quantizes the 4-bit LLAMA1-65B model
within only 4.3 hours on a single GPU, achieving a commendable tradeoff between
performance and quantization efficiency.

that non-expert users can jailbreak LLMs by simply manipulating their prompts;
resulting in degenerate output behavior, privacy and security breaches,
offensive outputs, and violations of content regulator policies. Limited
studies have been conducted to formalize and analyze these attacks and their
mitigations. We bridge this gap by proposing a formalism and a taxonomy of
known (and possible) jailbreaks. We survey existing jailbreak methods and their
effectiveness on open-source and commercial LLMs (such as GPT-based models,
OPT, BLOOM, and FLAN-T5-XXL). We further discuss the challenges of jailbreak
detection in terms of their effectiveness against known attacks. For further
analysis, we release a dataset of model outputs across 3700 jailbreak prompts
over 4 tasks.

                                        <span>  Vision-Language (VL) models with the Two-Tower architecture have dominated
visual-language representation learning in recent years. Current VL models
either use lightweight uni-modal encoders and learn to extract, align and fuse
both modalities simultaneously in a deep cross-modal encoder, or feed the
last-layer uni-modal representations from the deep pre-trained uni-modal
encoders into the top cross-modal encoder. Both approaches potentially restrict
vision-language representation learning and limit model performance. In this
paper, we propose BridgeTower, which introduces multiple bridge layers that
build a connection between the top layers of uni-modal encoders and each layer
of the cross-modal encoder. This enables effective bottom-up cross-modal
alignment and fusion between visual and textual representations of different
semantic levels of pre-trained uni-modal encoders in the cross-modal encoder.
Pre-trained with only 4M images, BridgeTower achieves state-of-the-art
performance on various downstream vision-language tasks. In particular, on the
VQAv2 test-std set, BridgeTower achieves an accuracy of 78.73%, outperforming
the previous state-of-the-art model METER by 1.09% with the same pre-training
data and almost negligible additional parameters and computational costs.
Notably, when further scaling the model, BridgeTower achieves an accuracy of
81.15%, surpassing models that are pre-trained on orders-of-magnitude larger
datasets. Code and checkpoints are available at
https://github.com/microsoft/BridgeTower.

several candidates based on a given user and system utterance history. Most
existing works primarily focus on post-training and fine-tuning tailored for
cross-encoders. However, there are no post-training methods tailored for dense
encoders in dialogue response selection. We argue that when the current
language model, based on dense dialogue systems (such as BERT), is employed as
a dense encoder, it separately encodes dialogue context and response, leading
to a struggle to achieve the alignment of both representations. Thus, we
propose Dial-MAE (Dialogue Contextual Masking Auto-Encoder), a straightforward
yet effective post-training technique tailored for dense encoders in dialogue
response selection. Dial-MAE uses an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture to
compress the dialogue semantics into dense vectors, which achieves better
alignment between the features of the dialogue context and response. Our
experiments have demonstrated that Dial-MAE is highly effective, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on two commonly evaluated benchmarks.

foundation model for healthcare workflows. The narrative and unstructured
nature of clinical notes is a major obstacle for healthcare intelligentization.
We address a critical problem of structuring clinical notes into clinical data,
according to international interoperability standards. We collect and annotate
data for three subtasks, namely, international patient summary, clinical
impression and medical encounter. We then supervised fine-tuned a
state-of-the-art LLM using public and credentialed clinical data. The training
is orchestrated in a way that the target model can first support basic clinical
tasks such as abbreviation expansion and temporal information extraction, and
then learn to perform more complex downstream clinical tasks. Moreover, we
address several modeling challenges in the healthcare context, e.g., extra long
context window. Our blind pairwise evaluation shows that SoftTiger outperforms
other popular open-source models and GPT-3.5, comparable to Gemini-pro, with a
mild gap from GPT-4. We believe that LLMs may become a step-stone towards
healthcare digitalization and democratization. Therefore, we publicly release
SoftTiger models at scales of 13 billion and 70 billion parameters, as well as
datasets and code for our innovative scalable evaluation, hopefully, making a
significant contribution to the healthcare industry.

                                        <span>  The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has greatly
accelerated the development of applications in understanding integrated texts
and images. Recent works leverage image-caption datasets to train MLLMs,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on image-to-text tasks. However, there
are few studies exploring which layers of MLLMs make the most effort to the
global image information, which plays vital roles in multimodal comprehension
and generation. In this study, we find that the intermediate layers of models
can encode more global semantic information, whose representation vectors
perform better on visual-language entailment tasks, rather than the topmost
layers. We further probe models regarding local semantic representations
through object recognition tasks. We find that the topmost layers may
excessively focus on local information, leading to a diminished ability to
encode global information. Our code and data are released via

language models (LLMs) as part of encoders for biomedical imaging tasks, a
domain traditionally devoid of language or textual data. The approach diverges
from established methodologies by utilizing a frozen transformer block,
extracted from pre-trained LLMs, as an innovative encoder layer for the direct
processing of visual tokens. This strategy represents a significant departure
from the standard multi-modal vision-language frameworks, which typically hinge
on language-driven prompts and inputs. We found that these LLMs could boost
performance across a spectrum of biomedical imaging applications, including
both 2D and 3D visual classification tasks, serving as plug-and-play boosters.
More interestingly, as a byproduct, we found that the proposed framework
achieved superior performance, setting new state-of-the-art results on
extensive, standardized datasets in MedMNIST-2D and 3D. Through this work, we
aim to open new avenues for employing LLMs in biomedical imaging and enriching
the understanding of their potential in this specialized domain.

models (PLM-based IR) requires learning query representations and
query-document relations, in addition to downstream task-specific learning.
This study introduces coarse-tuning as an intermediate learning stage that
bridges pre-training and fine-tuning. By learning query representations and
query-document relations in coarse-tuning, we aim to reduce the load of
fine-tuning and improve the learning effect of downstream IR tasks. We propose
Query-Document Pair Prediction (QDPP) for coarse-tuning, which predicts the
appropriateness of query-document pairs. Evaluation experiments show that the
proposed method significantly improves MRR and/or nDCG@5 in four ad-hoc
document retrieval datasets. Furthermore, the results of the query prediction
task suggested that coarse-tuning facilitated learning of query representation
and query-document relations.

                                        <span>  Large language models (LLMs) still grapple with complex tasks like
mathematical reasoning. Despite significant efforts invested in improving
prefix prompts or reasoning process, the crucial role of problem context might
have been neglected. Accurate recognition of inputs is fundamental for solving
mathematical tasks, as ill-formed problems could potentially mislead LLM's
reasoning. In this study, we propose a new approach named Problem Elaboration
Prompting (PEP) to enhance the mathematical capacities of LLMs. Specifically,
PEP decomposes and elucidates the problem context before reasoning, therefore
enhancing the context modeling and parsing efficiency. Experiments across
datasets and models demonstrate promising performances: (1) PEP demonstrates an
overall enhancement in various mathematical tasks. For instance, with the
GPT-3.5 model, PEP exhibits improvements of 9.93% and 8.80% on GSM8k through
greedy decoding and self-consistency, respectively. (2) PEP can be easily
implemented and integrated with other prompting methods. (3) PEP shows
particular strength in handling distraction problems.

following the invasion of Ukraine, Russian media outlets such as Russia Today
and Sputnik News were banned throughout Europe. To maintain viewership, many of
these Russian outlets began to heavily promote their content on messaging
services like Telegram. In this work, we study how 16 Russian media outlets
interacted with and utilized 732 Telegram channels throughout 2022. Leveraging
the foundational model MPNet, DP-means clustering, and Hawkes processes, we
trace how narratives spread between news sites and Telegram channels. We show
that news outlets not only propagate existing narratives through Telegram but
that they source material from the messaging platform. For example, across the
websites in our study, between 2.3% (ura.news) and 26.7% (ukraina.ru) of
articles discussed content that originated/resulted from activity on Telegram.
Finally, tracking the spread of individual topics, we measure the rate at which
news outlets and Telegram channels disseminate content within the Russian media
ecosystem, finding that websites like ura.news and Telegram channels such as
@genshab are the most effective at disseminating their content.

synthetic data. In our evaluation, we thoroughly assessed existing audio and
audio-visual models against multiple criteria and proposed settings to enhance
their performance on real-world data. We also conducted experiments to
investigate the impact of incorporating visual data (i.e., images and depth)
into neural acoustic field models. Additionally, we demonstrated the
effectiveness of a simple sim2real approach, where a model is pre-trained with
simulated data and fine-tuned with sparse real-world data, resulting in
significant improvements in the few-shot learning approach. RAF is the first
dataset to provide densely captured room acoustic data, making it an ideal
resource for researchers working on audio and audio-visual neural acoustic
field modeling techniques. Demos and datasets are available on our project

                                        <span>  Faithful human performance capture and free-view rendering from sparse RGB
observations is a long-standing problem in Vision and Graphics. The main
challenges are the lack of observations and the inherent ambiguities of the
setting, e.g. occlusions and depth ambiguity. As a result, radiance fields,
which have shown great promise in capturing high-frequency appearance and
geometry details in dense setups, perform poorly when na\"ively supervising
them on sparse camera views, as the field simply overfits to the sparse-view
inputs. To address this, we propose MetaCap, a method for efficient and
high-quality geometry recovery and novel view synthesis given very sparse or
even a single view of the human. Our key idea is to meta-learn the radiance
field weights solely from potentially sparse multi-view videos, which can serve
as a prior when fine-tuning them on sparse imagery depicting the human. This
prior provides a good network weight initialization, thereby effectively
addressing ambiguities in sparse-view capture. Due to the articulated structure
of the human body and motion-induced surface deformations, learning such a
prior is non-trivial. Therefore, we propose to meta-learn the field weights in
a pose-canonicalized space, which reduces the spatial feature range and makes
feature learning more effective. Consequently, one can fine-tune our field
parameters to quickly generalize to unseen poses, novel illumination conditions
as well as novel and sparse (even monocular) camera views. For evaluating our
method under different scenarios, we collect a new dataset, WildDynaCap, which
contains subjects captured in, both, a dense camera dome and in-the-wild sparse
camera rigs, and demonstrate superior results compared to recent
state-of-the-art methods on both public and WildDynaCap dataset.

                                        <span>  The Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset has been instrumental in
benchmarking object detectors over the past decade. Like every dataset, COCO
contains subtle errors and imperfections stemming from its annotation
procedure. With the advent of high-performing models, we ask whether these
errors of COCO are hindering its utility in reliably benchmarking further
progress. In search for an answer, we inspect thousands of masks from COCO
(2017 version) and uncover different types of errors such as imprecise mask
boundaries, non-exhaustively annotated instances, and mislabeled masks. Due to
the prevalence of COCO, we choose to correct these errors to maintain
continuity with prior research. We develop COCO-ReM (Refined Masks), a cleaner
set of annotations with visibly better mask quality than COCO-2017. We evaluate
fifty object detectors and find that models that predict visually sharper masks
score higher on COCO-ReM, affirming that they were being incorrectly penalized
due to errors in COCO-2017. Moreover, our models trained using COCO-ReM
converge faster and score higher than their larger variants trained using
COCO-2017, highlighting the importance of data quality in improving object
detectors. With these findings, we advocate using COCO-ReM for future object
detection research. Our dataset is available at https://cocorem.xyz

that violate physical laws, particularly the effects of objects on the scene,
e.g., occlusions, shadows, and reflections. By analyzing the limitations of
self-supervised approaches, we propose a practical solution centered on a
\q{counterfactual} dataset. Our method involves capturing a scene before and
after removing a single object, while minimizing other changes. By fine-tuning
a diffusion model on this dataset, we are able to not only remove objects but
also their effects on the scene. However, we find that applying this approach
for photorealistic object insertion requires an impractically large dataset. To
tackle this challenge, we propose bootstrap supervision; leveraging our object
removal model trained on a small counterfactual dataset, we synthetically
expand this dataset considerably. Our approach significantly outperforms prior
methods in photorealistic object removal and insertion, particularly at
modeling the effects of objects on the scene.

                                        <span>  We introduce Garment3DGen a new method to synthesize 3D garment assets from a
base mesh given a single input image as guidance. Our proposed approach allows
users to generate 3D textured clothes based on both real and synthetic images,
such as those generated by text prompts. The generated assets can be directly
draped and simulated on human bodies. First, we leverage the recent progress of
image to 3D diffusion methods to generate 3D garment geometries. However, since
these geometries cannot be utilized directly for downstream tasks, we propose
to use them as pseudo ground-truth and set up a mesh deformation optimization
procedure that deforms a base template mesh to match the generated 3D target.
Second, we introduce carefully designed losses that allow the input base mesh
to freely deform towards the desired target, yet preserve mesh quality and
topology such that they can be simulated. Finally, a texture estimation module
generates high-fidelity texture maps that are globally and locally consistent
and faithfully capture the input guidance, allowing us to render the generated
3D assets. With Garment3DGen users can generate the textured 3D garment of
their choice without the need of artist intervention. One can provide a textual
prompt describing the garment they desire to generate a simulation-ready 3D
asset. We present a plethora of quantitative and qualitative comparisons on
various assets both real and generated and provide use-cases of how one can
generate simulation-ready 3D garments.

enhancing multi-modality Vision Language Models (VLMs). Despite the
advancements in VLMs facilitating basic visual dialog and reasoning, a
performance gap persists compared to advanced models like GPT-4 and Gemini. We
try to narrow the gap by mining the potential of VLMs for better performance
and any-to-any workflow from three aspects, i.e., high-resolution visual
tokens, high-quality data, and VLM-guided generation. To enhance visual tokens,
we propose to utilize an additional visual encoder for high-resolution
refinement without increasing the visual token count. We further construct a
high-quality dataset that promotes precise image comprehension and
reasoning-based generation, expanding the operational scope of current VLMs. In
general, Mini-Gemini further mines the potential of VLMs and empowers current
frameworks with image understanding, reasoning, and generation simultaneously.
Mini-Gemini supports a series of dense and MoE Large Language Models (LLMs)
from 2B to 34B. It is demonstrated to achieve leading performance in several
zero-shot benchmarks and even surpasses the developed private models. Code and
models are available at https://github.com/dvlab-research/MiniGemini.

                                        <span>  We introduce a novel task within the field of 3D dance generation, termed
dance accompaniment, which necessitates the generation of responsive movements
from a dance partner, the "follower", synchronized with the lead dancer's
movements and the underlying musical rhythm. Unlike existing solo or group
dance generation tasks, a duet dance scenario entails a heightened degree of
interaction between the two participants, requiring delicate coordination in
both pose and position. To support this task, we first build a large-scale and
diverse duet interactive dance dataset, DD100, by recording about 117 minutes
of professional dancers' performances. To address the challenges inherent in
this task, we propose a GPT-based model, Duolando, which autoregressively
predicts the subsequent tokenized motion conditioned on the coordinated
information of the music, the leader's and the follower's movements. To further
enhance the GPT's capabilities of generating stable results on unseen
conditions (music and leader motions), we devise an off-policy reinforcement
learning strategy that allows the model to explore viable trajectories from
out-of-distribution samplings, guided by human-defined rewards. Based on the
collected dataset and proposed method, we establish a benchmark with several
carefully designed metrics.

                                        <span>  In the absence of parallax cues, a learning-based single image depth
estimation (SIDE) model relies heavily on shading and contextual cues in the
image. While this simplicity is attractive, it is necessary to train such
models on large and varied datasets, which are difficult to capture. It has
been shown that using embeddings from pre-trained foundational models, such as
CLIP, improves zero shot transfer in several applications. Taking inspiration
from this, in our paper we explore the use of global image priors generated
from a pre-trained ViT model to provide more detailed contextual information.
We argue that the embedding vector from a ViT model, pre-trained on a large
dataset, captures greater relevant information for SIDE than the usual route of
generating pseudo image captions, followed by CLIP based text embeddings. Based
on this idea, we propose a new SIDE model using a diffusion backbone which is
conditioned on ViT embeddings. Our proposed design establishes a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) for SIDE on NYUv2 dataset, achieving Abs Rel error of
0.059(14% improvement) compared to 0.069 by the current SOTA (VPD). And on
KITTI dataset, achieving Sq Rel error of 0.139 (2% improvement) compared to
0.142 by the current SOTA (GEDepth). For zero-shot transfer with a model
trained on NYUv2, we report mean relative improvement of (20%, 23%, 81%, 25%)
over NeWCRFs on (Sun-RGBD, iBims1, DIODE, HyperSim) datasets, compared to (16%,
18%, 45%, 9%) by ZoeDepth. The code is available at

single image with growing demands for automated 3D content creation pipelines.
Previous methods primarily rely on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) and Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF). Despite their significant success, these approaches
encounter practical limitations due to lengthy optimization and considerable
memory usage. In this report, we introduce Gamba, an end-to-end amortized 3D
reconstruction model from single-view images, emphasizing two main insights:
(1) 3D representation: leveraging a large number of 3D Gaussians for an
efficient 3D Gaussian splatting process; (2) Backbone design: introducing a
Mamba-based sequential network that facilitates context-dependent reasoning and
linear scalability with the sequence (token) length, accommodating a
substantial number of Gaussians. Gamba incorporates significant advancements in
data preprocessing, regularization design, and training methodologies. We
assessed Gamba against existing optimization-based and feed-forward 3D
generation approaches using the real-world scanned OmniObject3D dataset. Here,
Gamba demonstrates competitive generation capabilities, both qualitatively and
quantitatively, while achieving remarkable speed, approximately 0.6 second on a
single NVIDIA A100 GPU.

                                        <span>  Estimating the pose of objects from images is a crucial task of 3D scene
understanding, and recent approaches have shown promising results on very large
benchmarks. However, these methods experience a significant performance drop
when dealing with unseen objects. We believe that it results from the limited
generalizability of image features. To address this problem, we have an
in-depth analysis on the features of diffusion models, e.g. Stable Diffusion,
which hold substantial potential for modeling unseen objects. Based on this
analysis, we then innovatively introduce these diffusion features for object
pose estimation. To achieve this, we propose three distinct architectures that
can effectively capture and aggregate diffusion features of different
granularity, greatly improving the generalizability of object pose estimation.
Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a considerable margin
on three popular benchmark datasets, LM, O-LM, and T-LESS. In particular, our
method achieves higher accuracy than the previous best arts on unseen objects:
98.2% vs. 93.5% on Unseen LM, 85.9% vs. 76.3% on Unseen O-LM, showing the
strong generalizability of our method. Our code is released at

human face reconstruction without reliance on accurate pre-determined geometry.
Our method is designed to simultaneously deliver both high-quality novel view
rendering and accurate 3D mesh reconstructions. We incorporate a generic 3D
Morphable Model (3DMM) to provide a surface geometric structure, making it
possible to reconstruct faces with a limited set of input images. We introduce
a joint optimization strategy that refines both the Gaussians and the morphable
surface through a synergistic non-rigid alignment process. A novel distance
metric, splat-to-surface, is proposed to improve alignment by considering both
the Gaussian position and covariance. The surface information is also utilized
to incorporate a world-space densification process, resulting in superior
reconstruction quality. Our experimental analysis demonstrates that the
proposed method is competitive with both other Gaussian splatting techniques in
novel view synthesis and other 3D reconstruction methods in producing 3D face
meshes with high geometric precision.

for synthesizing hard images that benchmark deep models' robustness. Leveraging
diffusion models, we are able to generate images with more diversified
backgrounds, textures, and materials than any prior work, where we term this

                                        <span>  Place recognition is an important task for robots and autonomous cars to
localize themselves and close loops in pre-built maps. While single-modal
sensor-based methods have shown satisfactory performance, cross-modal place
recognition that retrieving images from a point-cloud database remains a
challenging problem. Current cross-modal methods transform images into 3D
points using depth estimation for modality conversion, which are usually
computationally intensive and need expensive labeled data for depth
supervision. In this work, we introduce a fast and lightweight framework to
encode images and point clouds into place-distinctive descriptors. We propose
an effective Field of View (FoV) transformation module to convert point clouds
into an analogous modality as images. This module eliminates the necessity for
depth estimation and helps subsequent modules achieve real-time performance. We
further design a non-negative factorization-based encoder to extract mutually
consistent semantic features between point clouds and images. This encoder
yields more distinctive global descriptors for retrieval. Experimental results
on the KITTI dataset show that our proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art
performance while running in real time. Additional evaluation on the HAOMO
dataset covering a 17 km trajectory further shows the practical generalization
capabilities. We have released the implementation of our methods as open source
at: https://github.com/haomo-ai/ModaLink.git.

                                        <span>  Aims. To develop a deep-learning based system for recognition of subclinical
atherosclerosis on a plain frontal chest x-ray. Methods and Results. A
deep-learning algorithm to predict coronary artery calcium (CAC) score (the
AI-CAC model) was developed on 460 chest x-ray (80% training cohort, 20%
internal validation cohort) of primary prevention patients (58.4% male, median
age 63 [51-74] years) with available paired chest x-ray and chest computed
tomography (CT) indicated for any clinical reason and performed within 3
months. The CAC score calculated on chest CT was used as ground truth. The
model was validated on an temporally-independent cohort of 90 patients from the
same institution (external validation). The diagnostic accuracy of the AI-CAC
model assessed by the area under the curve (AUC) was the primary outcome.
Overall, median AI-CAC score was 35 (0-388) and 28.9% patients had no AI-CAC.
AUC of the AI-CAC model to identify a CAC>0 was 0.90 in the internal validation
cohort and 0.77 in the external validation cohort. Sensitivity was consistently
above 92% in both cohorts. In the overall cohort (n=540), among patients with
AI-CAC=0, a single ASCVD event occurred, after 4.3 years. Patients with
AI-CAC>0 had significantly higher Kaplan Meier estimates for ASCVD events
(13.5% vs. 3.4%, log-rank=0.013). Conclusion. The AI-CAC model seems to
accurately detect subclinical atherosclerosis on chest x-ray with elevated
sensitivity, and to predict ASCVD events with elevated negative predictive
value. Adoption of the AI-CAC model to refine CV risk stratification or as an
opportunistic screening tool requires prospective evaluation.

constituents of the cerebral vascular tree: the cerebral arteries, the
bifurcations and the intracranial aneurysms. By building this model, our goal
was to provide a substantial dataset of brain arteries which could be used by a
3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to either segment or detect/recognize
various vascular diseases (such as artery dissection/thrombosis) or even some
portions of the cerebral vasculature, such as the bifurcations or aneurysms. In
this study, we will particularly focus on Intra-Cranial Aneurysm (ICA)
detection and segmentation. The cerebral aneurysms most often occur on a
particular structure of the vascular tree named the Circle of Willis. Various
studies have been conducted to detect and monitor the ICAs and those based on
Deep Learning (DL) achieve the best performances. Specifically, in this work,
we propose a full synthetic 3D model able to mimic the brain vasculature as
acquired by Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA), and more particularly the
Time Of Flight (TOF) principle. Among the various MRI modalities, the MRA-TOF
allows to have a relatively good rendering of the blood vessels and is
non-invasive (no contrast liquid injection). Our model has been designed to
simultaneously mimic the arteries geometry, the ICA shape and the background
noise. The geometry of the vascular tree is modeled thanks to an interpolation
with 3D Spline functions, and the statistical properties of the background MRI
noise is collected from MRA acquisitions and reproduced within the model. In
this work, we thoroughly describe the synthetic vasculature model, we build up
a neural network designed for ICA segmentation and detection, and finally, we
carry out an in-depth evaluation of the performance gap gained thanks to the
synthetic model data augmentation.

results in performance enhancements, paving the way for potential reductions in

                                        <span>  Lighting normalization is a crucial but underexplored restoration task with
broad applications. However, existing works often simplify this task within the
context of shadow removal, limiting the light sources to one and
oversimplifying the scene, thus excluding complex self-shadows and restricting
surface classes to smooth ones. Although promising, such simplifications hinder
generalizability to more realistic settings encountered in daily use. In this
paper, we propose a new challenging task termed Ambient Lighting Normalization
(ALN), which enables the study of interactions between shadows, unifying image
restoration and shadow removal in a broader context. To address the lack of
appropriate datasets for ALN, we introduce the large-scale high-resolution
dataset Ambient6K, comprising samples obtained from multiple light sources and
including self-shadows resulting from complex geometries, which is the first of
its kind. For benchmarking, we select various mainstream methods and rigorously
evaluate them on Ambient6K. Additionally, we propose IFBlend, a novel strong
baseline that maximizes Image-Frequency joint entropy to selectively restore
local areas under different lighting conditions, without relying on shadow
localization priors. Experiments show that IFBlend achieves SOTA scores on
Ambient6K and exhibits competitive performance on conventional shadow removal
benchmarks compared to shadow-specific models with mask priors. The dataset,
benchmark, and code are available at https://github.com/fvasluianu97/IFBlend.

if $y$ had been $z$?" is fundamental for advancing medical image analysis.
Training causal generative models that address such counterfactual questions,
though, currently requires that all relevant variables have been observed and
that corresponding labels are available in training data. However, clinical
data may not have complete records for all patients and state of the art causal
generative models are unable to take full advantage of this. We thus develop,
for the first time, a semi-supervised deep causal generative model that
exploits the causal relationships between variables to maximise the use of all
available data. We explore this in the setting where each sample is either
fully labelled or fully unlabelled, as well as the more clinically realistic
case of having different labels missing for each sample. We leverage techniques
from causal inference to infer missing values and subsequently generate
realistic counterfactuals, even for samples with incomplete labels.

contextually detailed and coherent responses from visual inputs. However, their
application in multimodal decision-making and open-ended generation is hindered
by a notable rate of hallucinations, where generated text inaccurately
represents the visual contents. To address this issue, this paper introduces
the Instruction Contrastive Decoding (ICD) method, a novel approach designed to
reduce hallucinations during LVLM inference. Our method is inspired by our
observation that what we call disturbance instructions significantly exacerbate
hallucinations in multimodal fusion modules. ICD contrasts distributions from
standard and instruction disturbance, thereby increasing alignment uncertainty
and effectively subtracting hallucinated concepts from the original
distribution. Through comprehensive experiments on discriminative benchmarks
(POPE and MME) and a generative benchmark (LLaVa-Bench), we demonstrate that
ICD significantly mitigates both object-level and attribute-level
hallucinations. Moreover, our method not only addresses hallucinations but also
significantly enhances the general perception and recognition capabilities of
LVLMs.

                                        <span>  AI-Generated Images (AGIs) have inherent multimodal nature. Unlike
traditional image quality assessment (IQA) on natural scenarios, AGIs quality
assessment (AGIQA) takes the correspondence of image and its textual prompt
into consideration. This is coupled in the ground truth score, which confuses
the unimodal IQA methods. To solve this problem, we introduce IP-IQA (AGIs
Quality Assessment via Image and Prompt), a multimodal framework for AGIQA via
corresponding image and prompt incorporation. Specifically, we propose a novel
incremental pretraining task named Image2Prompt for better understanding of
AGIs and their corresponding textual prompts. An effective and efficient
image-prompt fusion module, along with a novel special [QA] token, are also
applied. Both are plug-and-play and beneficial for the cooperation of image and
its corresponding prompt. Experiments demonstrate that our IP-IQA achieves the
state-of-the-art on AGIQA-1k and AGIQA-3k datasets. Code will be available.

                                        <span>  Current stereo-vision pipelines produce high accuracy 3D reconstruction when
using multiple pairs or triplets of satellite images. However, these pipelines
are sensitive to the changes between images that can occur as a result of
multi-date acquisitions. Such variations are mainly due to variable shadows,
reflexions and transient objects (cars, vegetation). To take such changes into
account, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have recently been applied to multi-date
satellite imagery. However, Neural methods are very compute-intensive, taking
dozens of hours to learn, compared with minutes for standard stereo-vision
pipelines. Following the ideas of Instant Neural Graphics Primitives we propose
to use an efficient sampling strategy and multi-resolution hash encoding to
accelerate the learning. Our model, Satellite Neural Graphics Primitives
(SAT-NGP) decreases the learning time to 15 minutes while maintaining the
quality of the 3D reconstruction.

                                        <span>  Few-shot model compression aims to compress a large model into a more compact
one with only a tiny training set (even without labels). Block-level pruning
has recently emerged as a leading technique in achieving high accuracy and low
latency in few-shot CNN compression. But, few-shot compression for Vision
Transformers (ViT) remains largely unexplored, which presents a new challenge.
In particular, the issue of sparse compression exists in traditional CNN
few-shot methods, which can only produce very few compressed models of
different model sizes. This paper proposes a novel framework for few-shot ViT
compression named DC-ViT. Instead of dropping the entire block, DC-ViT
selectively eliminates the attention module while retaining and reusing
portions of the MLP module. DC-ViT enables dense compression, which outputs
numerous compressed models that densely populate the range of model complexity.
DC-ViT outperforms state-of-the-art few-shot compression methods by a
significant margin of 10 percentage points, along with lower latency in the
compression of ViT and its variants.

                                        <span>  Recent breakthroughs in machine and deep learning (ML and DL) research have
provided excellent tools for leveraging enormous amounts of data and optimizing
huge models with millions of parameters to obtain accurate networks for image
processing. These developments open up tremendous opportunities for using
artificial intelligence (AI) in the automation and human assisted AI industry.
However, as more and more models are deployed and used in practice, many
challenges have emerged. This thesis presents various approaches that address
robustness and explainability challenges for using ML and DL in practice.
  Robustness and reliability are the critical components of any model before
certification and deployment in practice. Deep convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) exhibit vulnerability to transformations of their inputs, such as
rotation and scaling, or intentional manipulations as described in the
adversarial attack literature. In addition, building trust in AI-based models
requires a better understanding of current models and developing methods that
are more explainable and interpretable a priori.
  This thesis presents developments in computer vision models' robustness and
explainability. Furthermore, this thesis offers an example of using vision
models' feature response visualization (models' interpretations) to improve
robustness despite interpretability and robustness being seemingly unrelated in
the related research. Besides methodological developments for robust and
explainable vision models, a key message of this thesis is introducing model
interpretation techniques as a tool for understanding vision models and
improving their design and robustness. In addition to the theoretical
developments, this thesis demonstrates several applications of ML and DL in
different contexts, such as medical imaging and affective computing.

significant attention in image editing. However, despite encompassing a wide
range of editing priors, these methods are helpless when handling editing tasks
that are challenging to accurately describe through language. We propose
InstructBrush, an inversion method for instruction-based image editing methods
to bridge this gap. It extracts editing effects from exemplar image pairs as
editing instructions, which are further applied for image editing. Two key
techniques are introduced into InstructBrush, Attention-based Instruction
Optimization and Transformation-oriented Instruction Initialization, to address
the limitations of the previous method in terms of inversion effects and
instruction generalization. To explore the ability of instruction inversion
methods to guide image editing in open scenarios, we establish a
TransformationOriented Paired Benchmark (TOP-Bench), which contains a rich set
of scenes and editing types. The creation of this benchmark paves the way for
further exploration of instruction inversion. Quantitatively and qualitatively,
our approach achieves superior performance in editing and is more semantically
consistent with the target editing effects.

                                        <span>  Data annotation in autonomous vehicles is a critical step in the development
of Deep Neural Network (DNN) based models or the performance evaluation of the
perception system. This often takes the form of adding 3D bounding boxes on
time-sequential and registered series of point-sets captured from active
sensors like Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Radio Detection and
Ranging (RADAR). When annotating multiple active sensors, there is a need to
motion compensate and translate the points to a consistent coordinate frame and
timestamp respectively. However, highly dynamic objects pose a unique
challenge, as they can appear at different timestamps in each sensor's data.
Without knowing the speed of the objects, their position appears to be
different in different sensor outputs. Thus, even after motion compensation,
highly dynamic objects are not matched from multiple sensors in the same frame,
and human annotators struggle to add unique bounding boxes that capture all
objects. This article focuses on addressing this challenge, primarily within
the context of Scania collected datasets. The proposed solution takes a track
of an annotated object as input and uses the Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) to
robustly estimate its speed. The estimated speed profile is utilized to correct
the position of the annotated box and add boxes to object clusters missed by
the original annotation.

editing problems, such as unrealistic results due to shape discrepancies and
limited control in object replacement or insertion. To this end, we introduce
FlexEdit, a flexible and controllable editing framework for objects where we
iteratively adjust latents at each denoising step using our FlexEdit block.
Initially, we optimize latents at test time to align with specified object
constraints. Then, our framework employs an adaptive mask, automatically
extracted during denoising, to protect the background while seamlessly blending
new content into the target image. We demonstrate the versatility of FlexEdit
in various object editing tasks and curate an evaluation test suite with
samples from both real and synthetic images, along with novel evaluation
metrics designed for object-centric editing. We conduct extensive experiments
on different editing scenarios, demonstrating the superiority of our editing
framework over recent advanced text-guided image editing methods. Our project

                                        <span>  Procedure Planning in instructional videos entails generating a sequence of
action steps based on visual observations of the initial and target states.
Despite the rapid progress in this task, there remain several critical
challenges to be solved: (1) Adaptive procedures: Prior works hold an
unrealistic assumption that the number of action steps is known and fixed,
leading to non-generalizable models in real-world scenarios where the sequence
length varies. (2) Temporal relation: Understanding the step temporal relation
knowledge is essential in producing reasonable and executable plans. (3)
Annotation cost: Annotating instructional videos with step-level labels (i.e.,
timestamp) or sequence-level labels (i.e., action category) is demanding and
labor-intensive, limiting its generalizability to large-scale datasets.In this
work, we propose a new and practical setting, called adaptive procedure
planning in instructional videos, where the procedure length is not fixed or
pre-determined. To address these challenges we introduce Retrieval-Augmented
Planner (RAP) model. Specifically, for adaptive procedures, RAP adaptively
determines the conclusion of actions using an auto-regressive model
architecture. For temporal relation, RAP establishes an external memory module
to explicitly retrieve the most relevant state-action pairs from the training
videos and revises the generated procedures. To tackle high annotation cost,
RAP utilizes a weakly-supervised learning manner to expand the training dataset
to other task-relevant, unannotated videos by generating pseudo labels for
action steps. Experiments on CrossTask and COIN benchmarks show the superiority
of RAP over traditional fixed-length models, establishing it as a strong
baseline solution for adaptive procedure planning.

                                        <span>  The tokenizer, as one of the fundamental components of large models, has long
been overlooked or even misunderstood in visual tasks. One key factor of the
great comprehension power of the large language model is that natural language
tokenizers utilize meaningful words or subwords as the basic elements of
language. In contrast, mainstream visual tokenizers, represented by patch-based
methods such as Patch Embed, rely on meaningless rectangular patches as basic
elements of vision, which cannot serve as effectively as words or subwords in
language. Starting from the essence of the tokenizer, we defined semantically
independent regions (SIRs) for vision. We designed a simple HOmogeneous visual
tOKenizer: HOOK. HOOK mainly consists of two modules: the Object Perception
Module (OPM) and the Object Vectorization Module (OVM). To achieve homogeneity,
the OPM splits the image into 4*4 pixel seeds and then utilizes the attention
mechanism to perceive SIRs. The OVM employs cross-attention to merge seeds
within the same SIR. To achieve adaptability, the OVM defines a variable number
of learnable vectors as cross-attention queries, allowing for the adjustment of
token quantity. We conducted experiments on the NWPU-RESISC45, WHU-RS19
classification dataset, and GID5 segmentation dataset for sparse and dense
tasks. The results demonstrate that the visual tokens obtained by HOOK
correspond to individual objects, which demonstrates homogeneity. HOOK
outperformed Patch Embed by 6\% and 10\% in the two tasks and achieved
state-of-the-art performance compared to the baselines used for comparison.
Compared to Patch Embed, which requires more than one hundred tokens for one
image, HOOK requires only 6 and 8 tokens for sparse and dense tasks,
respectively, resulting in efficiency improvements of 1.5 to 2.8 times. The
code is available at https://github.com/GeoX-Lab/Hook.

                                        <span>  Resource efficiency plays an important role for machine learning nowadays.
The energy and decision latency are two critical aspects to ensure a
sustainable and practical application. Unfortunately, the energy consumption
and decision latency are not robust against adversaries. Researchers have
recently demonstrated that attackers can compute and submit so-called sponge
examples at inference time to increase the energy consumption and decision
latency of neural networks. In computer vision, the proposed strategy crafts
inputs with less activation sparsity which could otherwise be used to
accelerate the computation. In this paper, we analyze the mechanism how these
energy-latency attacks reduce activation sparsity. In particular, we find that
input uniformity is a key enabler. A uniform image, that is, an image with
mostly flat, uniformly colored surfaces, triggers more activations due to a
specific interplay of convolution, batch normalization, and ReLU activation.
Based on these insights, we propose two new simple, yet effective strategies
for crafting sponge examples: sampling images from a probability distribution
and identifying dense, yet inconspicuous inputs in natural datasets. We
empirically examine our findings in a comprehensive evaluation with multiple
image classification models and show that our attack achieves the same sparsity
effect as prior sponge-example methods, but at a fraction of computation
effort. We also show that our sponge examples transfer between different neural
networks. Finally, we discuss applications of our findings for the good by
improving efficiency by increasing sparsity.

due to the lack of diversity in existing real-world datasets. While data
synthesis helps relieve the issue, the syn-to-real gap still hinders its usage.
In this work, we present HandBooster, a new approach to uplift the data
diversity and boost the 3D hand-mesh reconstruction performance by training a
conditional generative space on hand-object interactions and purposely sampling
the space to synthesize effective data samples. First, we construct versatile
content-aware conditions to guide a diffusion model to produce realistic images
with diverse hand appearances, poses, views, and backgrounds; favorably,
accurate 3D annotations are obtained for free. Then, we design a novel
condition creator based on our similarity-aware distribution sampling
strategies to deliberately find novel and realistic interaction poses that are
distinctive from the training set. Equipped with our method, several baselines
can be significantly improved beyond the SOTA on the HO3D and DexYCB
benchmarks. Our code will be released on

cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), a medical imaging technique often used in
applications such as image-guided radiation therapy, implant dentistry or
orthopaedics. In particular, while deep learning methods have been applied to
reduce various types of CBCT image artifacts arising from motion, metal
objects, or low-dose acquisition, a comprehensive review summarizing the
successes and shortcomings of these approaches, with a primary focus on the
type of artifacts rather than the architecture of neural networks, is lacking
in the literature. In this review, the data generation and simulation
pipelines, and artifact reduction techniques are specifically investigated for
each type of artifact. We provide an overview of deep learning techniques that
have successfully been shown to reduce artifacts in 3D, as well as in
time-resolved (4D) CBCT through the use of projection- and/or volume-domain
optimizations, or by introducing neural networks directly within the CBCT
reconstruction algorithms. Research gaps are identified to suggest avenues for
future exploration. One of the key findings of this work is an observed trend
towards the use of generative models including GANs and score-based or
diffusion models, accompanied with the need for more diverse and open training
datasets and simulations.

                                        <span>  Co-salient object detection (CoSOD) aims to identify the common and salient
(usually in the foreground) regions across a given group of images. Although
achieving significant progress, state-of-the-art CoSODs could be easily
affected by some adversarial perturbations, leading to substantial accuracy
reduction. The adversarial perturbations can mislead CoSODs but do not change
the high-level semantic information (e.g., concept) of the co-salient objects.
In this paper, we propose a novel robustness enhancement framework by first
learning the concept of the co-salient objects based on the input group images
and then leveraging this concept to purify adversarial perturbations, which are
subsequently fed to CoSODs for robustness enhancement. Specifically, we propose
CosalPure containing two modules, i.e., group-image concept learning and
concept-guided diffusion purification. For the first module, we adopt a
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to learn the concept of co-salient
objects within group images where the learned concept is robust to adversarial
examples. For the second module, we map the adversarial image to the latent
space and then perform diffusion generation by embedding the learned concept
into the noise prediction function as an extra condition. Our method can
effectively alleviate the influence of the SOTA adversarial attack containing
different adversarial patterns, including exposure and noise. The extensive
results demonstrate that our method could enhance the robustness of CoSODs
significantly.

unlocked unprecedented synthesis quality of AI-generated content (AIGC)
including image generation, 3D and video composition. Further, personalized
techniques enable appealing customized production of a novel concept given only
several images as reference. However, an intriguing problem persists: Is it
possible to capture multiple, novel concepts from one single reference image?
In this paper, we identify that existing approaches fail to preserve visual
consistency with the reference image and eliminate cross-influence from
concepts. To alleviate this, we propose an attention calibration mechanism to
improve the concept-level understanding of the T2I model. Specifically, we
first introduce new learnable modifiers bound with classes to capture
attributes of multiple concepts. Then, the classes are separated and
strengthened following the activation of the cross-attention operation,
ensuring comprehensive and self-contained concepts. Additionally, we suppress
the attention activation of different classes to mitigate mutual influence
among concepts. Together, our proposed method, dubbed DisenDiff, can learn
disentangled multiple concepts from one single image and produce novel
customized images with learned concepts. We demonstrate that our method
outperforms the current state of the art in both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations. More importantly, our proposed techniques are compatible with LoRA
and inpainting pipelines, enabling more interactive experiences.

                                        <span>  Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) introduces a paradigm in which
the problem space expands with limited data. FSCIL methods inherently face the
challenge of catastrophic forgetting as data arrives incrementally, making
models susceptible to overwriting previously acquired knowledge. Moreover,
given the scarcity of labeled samples available at any given time, models may
be prone to overfitting and find it challenging to strike a balance between
extensive pretraining and the limited incremental data. To address these
challenges, we propose the OrCo framework built on two core principles:
features' orthogonality in the representation space, and contrastive learning.
In particular, we improve the generalization of the embedding space by
employing a combination of supervised and self-supervised contrastive losses
during the pretraining phase. Additionally, we introduce OrCo loss to address
challenges arising from data limitations during incremental sessions. Through
feature space perturbations and orthogonality between classes, the OrCo loss
maximizes margins and reserves space for the following incremental data. This,
in turn, ensures the accommodation of incoming classes in the feature space
without compromising previously acquired knowledge. Our experimental results
showcase state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets,
including mini-ImageNet, CIFAR100, and CUB datasets. Code is available at

                                        <span>  Existing research based on deep learning has extensively explored the problem
of daytime image dehazing. However, few studies have considered the
characteristics of nighttime hazy scenes. There are two distinctions between
nighttime and daytime haze. First, there may be multiple active colored light
sources with lower illumination intensity in nighttime scenes, which may cause
haze, glow and noise with localized, coupled and frequency inconsistent
characteristics. Second, due to the domain discrepancy between simulated and
real-world data, unrealistic brightness may occur when applying a dehazing
model trained on simulated data to real-world data. To address the above two
issues, we propose a semi-supervised model for real-world nighttime dehazing.
First, the spatial attention and frequency spectrum filtering are implemented
as a spatial-frequency domain information interaction module to handle the
first issue. Second, a pseudo-label-based retraining strategy and a local
window-based brightness loss for semi-supervised training process is designed
to suppress haze and glow while achieving realistic brightness. Experiments on
public benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its
superiority over state-of-the-art methods. The source code and Supplementary

                                        <span>  Fast and robust object grasping in clutter is a crucial component of
robotics. Most current works resort to the whole observed point cloud for 6-Dof
grasp generation, ignoring the guidance information excavated from global
semantics, thus limiting high-quality grasp generation and real-time
performance. In this work, we show that the widely used heatmaps are
underestimated in the efficiency of 6-Dof grasp generation. Therefore, we
propose an effective local grasp generator combined with grasp heatmaps as
guidance, which infers in a global-to-local semantic-to-point way.
Specifically, Gaussian encoding and the grid-based strategy are applied to
predict grasp heatmaps as guidance to aggregate local points into graspable
regions and provide global semantic information. Further, a novel non-uniform
anchor sampling mechanism is designed to improve grasp accuracy and diversity.
Benefiting from the high-efficiency encoding in the image space and focusing on
points in local graspable regions, our framework can perform high-quality grasp
detection in real-time and achieve state-of-the-art results. In addition, real
robot experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with a success
rate of 94% and a clutter completion rate of 100%. Our code is available at

                                        <span>  Vision-language models, such as CLIP, have shown promising
Out-of-Distribution (OoD) generalization under various types of distribution
shifts. Recent studies attempted to investigate the leading cause of this
capability. In this work, we follow the same path, but focus on a specific type
of OoD data - images with novel compositions of attribute-object pairs - and
study whether such models can successfully classify those images into
composition classes. We carefully designed an authentic image test dataset
called ImageNet-AO, consisting of attributes for objects that are unlikely
encountered in the CLIP training sets. We found that CLIPs trained with large
datasets such as OpenAI CLIP, LAION-400M, and LAION-2B show orders-of-magnitude
improvement in effective compositional OoD generalization compared to both
supervised models and CLIPs trained with smaller datasets, such as CC-12M and
YFCC-15M. Our results provide evidence that the scale and diversity of training
data and language supervision play a key role in unlocking the compositional
generalization abilities of vision-language models.

                                        <span>  Unsupervised pathology detection can be implemented by training a model on
healthy data only and measuring the deviation from the training set upon
inference, for example with CNN-based feature extraction and one-class
classifiers, or reconstruction-score-based methods such as AEs, GANs and
Diffusion models. Normalizing Flows (NF) have the ability to directly learn the
probability distribution of training examples through an invertible
architecture. We leverage this property in a novel 3D NF-based model named
CT-3DFlow, specifically tailored for patient-level pulmonary pathology
detection in chest CT data. Our model is trained unsupervised on healthy 3D
pulmonary CT patches, and detects deviations from its log-likelihood
distribution as anomalies. We aggregate patches-level likelihood values from a
patient's CT scan to provide a patient-level 'normal'/'abnormal' prediction.
Out-of-distribution detection performance is evaluated using expert annotations
on a separate chest CT test dataset, outperforming other state-of-the-art
methods.

motions that align with textual descriptions and exhibit coordinated movements.
Currently, the part-based methods introduce part partition into the motion
synthesis process to achieve finer-grained generation. However, these methods
encounter challenges such as the lack of coordination between different part
motions and difficulties for networks to understand part concepts. Moreover,
introducing finer-grained part concepts poses computational complexity
challenges. In this paper, we propose Part-Coordinating Text-to-Motion
Synthesis (ParCo), endowed with enhanced capabilities for understanding part
motions and communication among different part motion generators, ensuring a
coordinated and fined-grained motion synthesis. Specifically, we discretize
whole-body motion into multiple part motions to establish the prior concept of
different parts. Afterward, we employ multiple lightweight generators designed
to synthesize different part motions and coordinate them through our part
coordination module. Our approach demonstrates superior performance on common
benchmarks with economic computations, including HumanML3D and KIT-ML,
providing substantial evidence of its effectiveness. Code is available at

emerging as an important method for understanding the tumour micro-environment
in cancer. This work presents HEMIT, a dataset designed for translating
Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) sections to multiplex-immunohistochemistry (mIHC)
images, featuring DAPI, CD3, and panCK markers. Distinctively, HEMIT's mIHC
images are multi-component and cellular-level aligned with H&E, enriching
supervised stain translation tasks. To our knowledge, HEMIT is the first
publicly available cellular-level aligned dataset that enables H&E to
multi-target mIHC image translation. This dataset provides the computer vision
community with a valuable resource to develop novel computational methods which
have the potential to gain new insights from H&E slide archives.
  We also propose a new dual-branch generator architecture, using residual
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Swin Transformers which achieves
better translation outcomes than other popular algorithms. When evaluated on
HEMIT, it outperforms pix2pixHD, pix2pix, U-Net, and ResNet, achieving the
highest overall score on key metrics including the Structural Similarity Index

(PSNR). Additionally, downstream analysis has been used to further validate the

                                        <span>  Deep subsurface exploration is important for mining, oil and gas industries,
as well as in the assessment of geological units for the disposal of chemical
or nuclear waste, or the viability of geothermal energy systems. Typically,
detailed examinations of subsurface formations or units are performed on
cuttings or core materials extracted during drilling campaigns, as well as on
geophysical borehole data, which provide detailed information about the
petrophysical properties of the rocks. Depending on the volume of rock samples
and the analytical program, the laboratory analysis and diagnostics can be very
time-consuming. This study investigates the potential of utilizing machine
learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN), to assess the
lithology and mineral content solely from analysis of drill core images, aiming
to support and expedite the subsurface geological exploration. The paper
outlines a comprehensive methodology, encompassing data preprocessing, machine
learning methods, and transfer learning techniques. The outcome reveals a
remarkable 96.7% accuracy in the classification of drill core segments into
distinct formation classes. Furthermore, a CNN model was trained for the
evaluation of mineral content using a learning data set from multidimensional
log analysis data (silicate, total clay, carbonate). When benchmarked against
laboratory XRD measurements on samples from the cores, both the advanced
multidimensional log analysis model and the neural network approach developed
here provide equally good performance. This work demonstrates that deep
learning and particularly transfer learning can support extracting
petrophysical properties, including mineral content and formation
classification, from drill core images, thus offering a road map for enhancing
model performance and data set quality in image-based analysis of drill cores.

high-quality data, demonstrating impressive performance. However, these T2I
models still struggle to produce images that are aesthetically pleasing,
geometrically accurate, faithful to text, and of good low-level quality. We
present VersaT2I, a versatile training framework that can boost the performance
with multiple rewards of any T2I model. We decompose the quality of the image
into several aspects such as aesthetics, text-image alignment, geometry,
low-level quality, etc. Then, for every quality aspect, we select high-quality
images in this aspect generated by the model as the training set to finetune
the T2I model using the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Furthermore, we introduce a
gating function to combine multiple quality aspects, which can avoid conflicts
between different quality aspects. Our method is easy to extend and does not
require any manual annotation, reinforcement learning, or model architecture
changes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VersaT2I outperforms the
baseline methods across various quality criteria.

                                        <span>  This paper proposes a new knowledge distillation method tailored for image
semantic segmentation, termed Intra- and Inter-Class Knowledge Distillation
(I2CKD). The focus of this method is on capturing and transferring knowledge
between the intermediate layers of teacher (cumbersome model) and student
(compact model). For knowledge extraction, we exploit class prototypes derived
from feature maps. To facilitate knowledge transfer, we employ a triplet loss
in order to minimize intra-class variances and maximize inter-class variances
between teacher and student prototypes. Consequently, I2CKD enables the student
to better mimic the feature representation of the teacher for each class,
thereby enhancing the segmentation performance of the compact network.
Extensive experiments on three segmentation datasets, i.e., Cityscapes, Pascal
VOC and CamVid, using various teacher-student network pairs demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

                                        <span>  We present Stochastic Gaussian Splatting (SGS): the first framework for
uncertainty estimation using Gaussian Splatting (GS). GS recently advanced the
novel-view synthesis field by achieving impressive reconstruction quality at a
fraction of the computational cost of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). However,
contrary to the latter, it still lacks the ability to provide information about
the confidence associated with their outputs. To address this limitation, in
this paper, we introduce a Variational Inference-based approach that seamlessly
integrates uncertainty prediction into the common rendering pipeline of GS.
Additionally, we introduce the Area Under Sparsification Error (AUSE) as a new
term in the loss function, enabling optimization of uncertainty estimation
alongside image reconstruction. Experimental results on the LLFF dataset
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of both
image rendering quality and uncertainty estimation accuracy. Overall, our
framework equips practitioners with valuable insights into the reliability of
synthesized views, facilitating safer decision-making in real-world
applications.

annotating new domains. Self-training is a competitive approach for this task,
but its performance is limited by different sensor sampling patterns (i.e.,
variations in point density) and incomplete training strategies. In this work,
we propose a density-guided translator (DGT), which translates point density
between domains, and integrates it into a two-stage self-training pipeline
named DGT-ST. First, in contrast to existing works that simultaneously conduct
data generation and feature/output alignment within unstable adversarial
training, we employ the non-learnable DGT to bridge the domain gap at the input
level. Second, to provide a well-initialized model for self-training, we
propose a category-level adversarial network in stage one that utilizes the
prototype to prevent negative transfer. Finally, by leveraging the designs
above, a domain-mixed self-training method with source-aware consistency loss
is proposed in stage two to narrow the domain gap further. Experiments on two
synthetic-to-real segmentation tasks (SynLiDAR $\rightarrow$ semanticKITTI and
SynLiDAR $\rightarrow$ semanticPOSS) demonstrate that DGT-ST outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving 9.4$\%$ and 4.3$\%$ mIoU improvements,
respectively. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/yuan-zm/DGT-ST}.

artificial intelligence, deep learning, and high-performance computing. With
its advanced tools, digital pathology can help improve and speed up the
diagnostic process, reduce human errors, and streamline the reporting step. In
this paper, we report a new large red blood cell (RBC) image dataset and
propose a two-stage deep learning framework for RBC image segmentation and
classification. The dataset is a highly diverse dataset of more than 100K RBCs
containing eight different classes. The dataset, which is considerably larger
than any publicly available hematopathology dataset, was labeled independently
by two hematopathologists who also manually created masks for RBC cell
segmentation. Subsequently, in the proposed framework, first, a U-Net model was
trained to achieve automatic RBC image segmentation. Second, an EfficientNetB0
model was trained to classify RBC images into one of the eight classes using a
transfer learning approach with a 5X2 cross-validation scheme. An IoU of 98.03%
and an average classification accuracy of 96.5% were attained on the test set.
Moreover, we have performed experimental comparisons against several prominent
CNN models. These comparisons show the superiority of the proposed model with a
good balance between performance and computational cost.

                                        <span>  Image style transfer aims to imbue digital imagery with the distinctive
attributes of style targets, such as colors, brushstrokes, shapes, whilst
concurrently preserving the semantic integrity of the content. Despite the
advancements in arbitrary style transfer methods, a prevalent challenge remains
the delicate equilibrium between content semantics and style attributes. Recent
developments in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have heralded
unprecedented synthesis capabilities, albeit at the expense of relying on
extensive and often imprecise textual descriptions to delineate artistic
styles. Addressing these limitations, this paper introduces DiffStyler, a novel
approach that facilitates efficient and precise arbitrary image style transfer.
DiffStyler lies the utilization of a text-to-image Stable Diffusion model-based
LoRA to encapsulate the essence of style targets. This approach, coupled with
strategic cross-LoRA feature and attention injection, guides the style transfer
process. The foundation of our methodology is rooted in the observation that
LoRA maintains the spatial feature consistency of UNet, a discovery that
further inspired the development of a mask-wise style transfer technique. This
technique employs masks extracted through a pre-trained FastSAM model,
utilizing mask prompts to facilitate feature fusion during the denoising
process, thereby enabling localized style transfer that preserves the original
image's unaffected regions. Moreover, our approach accommodates multiple style
targets through the use of corresponding masks. Through extensive
experimentation, we demonstrate that DiffStyler surpasses previous methods in
achieving a more harmonious balance between content preservation and style
integration.

                                        <span>  The study of vision-and-language navigation (VLN) has typically relied on
expert trajectories, which may not always be available in real-world situations
due to the significant effort required to collect them. On the other hand,
existing approaches to training VLN agents that go beyond available expert data
involve data augmentations or online exploration which can be tedious and
risky. In contrast, it is easy to access large repositories of suboptimal
offline trajectories. Inspired by research in offline reinforcement learning
(ORL), we introduce a new problem setup of VLN-ORL which studies VLN using
suboptimal demonstration data. We introduce a simple and effective
reward-conditioned approach that can account for dataset suboptimality for
training VLN agents, as well as benchmarks to evaluate progress and promote
research in this area. We empirically study various noise models for
characterizing dataset suboptimality among other unique challenges in VLN-ORL
and instantiate it for the VLN$\circlearrowright$BERT and MTVM architectures in
the R2R and RxR environments. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed
reward-conditioned approach leads to significant performance improvements, even
in complex and intricate environments.

                                        <span>  There are five types of trajectory prediction tasks: deterministic,
stochastic, domain adaptation, momentary observation, and few-shot. These
associated tasks are defined by various factors, such as the length of input
paths, data split and pre-processing methods. Interestingly, even though they
commonly take sequential coordinates of observations as input and infer future
paths in the same coordinates as output, designing specialized architectures
for each task is still necessary. For the other task, generality issues can
lead to sub-optimal performances. In this paper, we propose SingularTrajectory,
a diffusion-based universal trajectory prediction framework to reduce the
performance gap across the five tasks. The core of SingularTrajectory is to
unify a variety of human dynamics representations on the associated tasks. To
do this, we first build a Singular space to project all types of motion
patterns from each task into one embedding space. We next propose an adaptive
anchor working in the Singular space. Unlike traditional fixed anchor methods
that sometimes yield unacceptable paths, our adaptive anchor enables correct
anchors, which are put into a wrong location, based on a traversability map.
Finally, we adopt a diffusion-based predictor to further enhance the prototype
paths using a cascaded denoising process. Our unified framework ensures the
generality across various benchmark settings such as input modality, and
trajectory lengths. Extensive experiments on five public benchmarks demonstrate
that SingularTrajectory substantially outperforms existing models, highlighting
its effectiveness in estimating general dynamics of human movements. Code is

                                        <span>  Language models have demonstrated impressive ability in context understanding
and generative performance. Inspired by the recent success of language
foundation models, in this paper, we propose LMTraj (Language-based Multimodal
Trajectory predictor), which recasts the trajectory prediction task into a sort
of question-answering problem. Departing from traditional numerical regression
models, which treat the trajectory coordinate sequence as continuous signals,
we consider them as discrete signals like text prompts. Specially, we first
transform an input space for the trajectory coordinate into the natural
language space. Here, the entire time-series trajectories of pedestrians are
converted into a text prompt, and scene images are described as text
information through image captioning. The transformed numerical and image data
are then wrapped into the question-answering template for use in a language
model. Next, to guide the language model in understanding and reasoning
high-level knowledge, such as scene context and social relationships between
pedestrians, we introduce an auxiliary multi-task question and answering. We
then train a numerical tokenizer with the prompt data. We encourage the
tokenizer to separate the integer and decimal parts well, and leverage it to
capture correlations between the consecutive numbers in the language model.
Lastly, we train the language model using the numerical tokenizer and all of
the question-answer prompts. Here, we propose a beam-search-based most-likely
prediction and a temperature-based multimodal prediction to implement both
deterministic and stochastic inferences. Applying our LMTraj, we show that the
language-based model can be a powerful pedestrian trajectory predictor, and
outperforms existing numerical-based predictor methods. Code is publicly

                                        <span>  Self-supervised monocular depth estimation methods have been increasingly
given much attention due to the benefit of not requiring large, labelled
datasets. Such self-supervised methods require high-quality salient features
and consequently suffer from severe performance drop for indoor scenes, where
low-textured regions dominant in the scenes are almost indiscriminative. To
address the issue, we propose a self-supervised indoor monocular depth
estimation framework called $\mathrm{F^2Depth}$. A self-supervised optical flow
estimation network is introduced to supervise depth learning. To improve
optical flow estimation performance in low-textured areas, only some patches of
points with more discriminative features are adopted for finetuning based on
our well-designed patch-based photometric loss. The finetuned optical flow
estimation network generates high-accuracy optical flow as a supervisory signal
for depth estimation. Correspondingly, an optical flow consistency loss is
designed. Multi-scale feature maps produced by finetuned optical flow
estimation network perform warping to compute feature map synthesis loss as
another supervisory signal for depth learning. Experimental results on the NYU
Depth V2 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework and our
proposed losses. To evaluate the generalization ability of our
$\mathrm{F^2Depth}$, we collect a Campus Indoor depth dataset composed of
approximately 1500 points selected from 99 images in 18 scenes. Zero-shot
generalization experiments on 7-Scenes dataset and Campus Indoor achieve
$\delta_1$ accuracy of 75.8% and 76.0% respectively. The accuracy results show
that our model can generalize well to monocular images captured in unknown
indoor scenes.

experiencing target domain shifts. Existing Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods
tend to apply computationally heavy and memory-intensive backpropagation-based
approaches to handle this. Here, we propose a novel method that uses a
backpropagation-free approach for TTA for the specific case of 3D data. Our
model uses a two-stream architecture to maintain knowledge about the source
domain as well as complementary target-domain-specific information. The
backpropagation-free property of our model helps address the well-known
forgetting problem and mitigates the error accumulation issue. The proposed
method also eliminates the need for the usually noisy process of
pseudo-labeling and reliance on costly self-supervised training. Moreover, our
method leverages subspace learning, effectively reducing the distribution
variance between the two domains. Furthermore, the source-domain-specific and
the target-domain-specific streams are aligned using a novel entropy-based
adaptive fusion strategy. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code will be available at

                                        <span>  Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in text-to-image
synthesis, producing realistic and high resolution images that faithfully
adhere to the corresponding text-prompts. Despite their great success, they
still fall behind in sketch-to-image synthesis tasks, where in addition to
text-prompts, the spatial layout of the generated images has to closely follow
the outlines of certain reference sketches. Employing an MLP latent edge
predictor to guide the spatial layout of the synthesized image by predicting
edge maps at each denoising step has been recently proposed. Despite yielding
promising results, the pixel-wise operation of the MLP does not take into
account the spatial layout as a whole, and demands numerous denoising
iterations to produce satisfactory images, leading to time inefficiency. To
this end, we introduce U-Sketch, a framework featuring a U-Net type latent edge
predictor, which is capable of efficiently capturing both local and global
features, as well as spatial correlations between pixels. Moreover, we propose
the addition of a sketch simplification network that offers the user the choice
of preprocessing and simplifying input sketches for enhanced outputs. The
experimental results, corroborated by user feedback, demonstrate that our
proposed U-Net latent edge predictor leads to more realistic results, that are
better aligned with the spatial outlines of the reference sketches, while
drastically reducing the number of required denoising steps and, consequently,
the overall execution time.

                                        <span>  The conditional text-to-image diffusion models have garnered significant
attention in recent years. However, the precision of these models is often
compromised mainly for two reasons, ambiguous condition input and inadequate
condition guidance over single denoising loss. To address the challenges, we
introduce two innovative solutions. Firstly, we propose a Spatial Guidance
Injector (SGI) which enhances conditional detail by encoding text inputs with
precise annotation information. This method directly tackles the issue of
ambiguous control inputs by providing clear, annotated guidance to the model.
Secondly, to overcome the issue of limited conditional supervision, we
introduce Diffusion Consistency Loss (DCL), which applies supervision on the
denoised latent code at any given time step. This encourages consistency
between the latent code at each time step and the input signal, thereby
enhancing the robustness and accuracy of the output. The combination of SGI and
DCL results in our Effective Controllable Network (ECNet), which offers a more
accurate controllable end-to-end text-to-image generation framework with a more
precise conditioning input and stronger controllable supervision. We validate
our approach through extensive experiments on generation under various
conditions, such as human body skeletons, facial landmarks, and sketches of
general objects. The results consistently demonstrate that our method
significantly enhances the controllability and robustness of the generated
images, outperforming existing state-of-the-art controllable text-to-image
models.

                                        <span>  Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a practical challenge in computer vision.
Pseudo-label (PL) methods, e.g., FixMatch and FreeMatch, obtain the State Of
The Art (SOTA) performances in SSL. These approaches employ a
threshold-to-pseudo-label (T2L) process to generate PLs by truncating the
confidence scores of unlabeled data predicted by the self-training method.
However, self-trained models typically yield biased and high-variance
predictions, especially in the scenarios when a little labeled data are
supplied. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight channel-based
ensemble method to effectively consolidate multiple inferior PLs into the
theoretically guaranteed unbiased and low-variance one. Importantly, our
approach can be readily extended to any SSL framework, such as FixMatch or
FreeMatch. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on CIFAR10/100 in terms of
effectiveness and efficiency.

                                        <span>  Stimulated by the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of recent Large
Language Models (LLMs), a variety of strategies for bridging video modality
have been devised. A prominent strategy involves Video Language Models
(VideoLMs), which train a learnable interface with video data to connect
advanced vision encoders with LLMs. Recently, an alternative strategy has
surfaced, employing readily available foundation models, such as VideoLMs and
LLMs, across multiple stages for modality bridging. In this study, we introduce
a simple yet novel strategy where only a single Vision Language Model (VLM) is
utilized. Our starting point is the plain insight that a video comprises a
series of images, or frames, interwoven with temporal information. The essence
of video comprehension lies in adeptly managing the temporal aspects along with
the spatial details of each frame. Initially, we transform a video into a
single composite image by arranging multiple frames in a grid layout. The
resulting single image is termed as an image grid. This format, while
maintaining the appearance of a solitary image, effectively retains temporal
information within the grid structure. Therefore, the image grid approach
enables direct application of a single high-performance VLM without
necessitating any video-data training. Our extensive experimental analysis
across ten zero-shot video question answering benchmarks, including five
open-ended and five multiple-choice benchmarks, reveals that the proposed Image
Grid Vision Language Model (IG-VLM) surpasses the existing methods in nine out
of ten benchmarks.

the ability to depict the emotions of an artist. Many researchers have made
attempts to study abstract art in the form of edge detection, brush stroke and
emotion recognition algorithms using machine and deep learning. This papers
describes the study of a wide distribution of abstract paintings using
Generative Adversarial Neural Networks(GAN). GANs have the ability to learn and
reproduce a distribution enabling researchers and scientists to effectively
explore and study the generated image space. However, the challenge lies in
developing an efficient GAN architecture that overcomes common training
pitfalls. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a modified-DCGAN
(mDCGAN) specifically designed for high-quality artwork generation. The
approach involves a thorough exploration of the modifications made, delving
into the intricate workings of DCGANs, optimisation techniques, and
regularisation methods aimed at improving stability and realism in art
generation enabling effective study of generated patterns. The proposed mDCGAN
incorporates meticulous adjustments in layer configurations and architectural
choices, offering tailored solutions to the unique demands of art generation
while effectively combating issues like mode collapse and gradient vanishing.
Further this paper explores the generated latent space by performing random
walks to understand vector relationships between brush strokes and colours in
the abstract art space and a statistical analysis of unstable outputs after a
certain period of GAN training and compare its significant difference. These
findings validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, emphasising its
potential to revolutionise the field of digital art generation and digital art
ecosystem.

computing compared with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), closely mirroring
biological neural processes. However, this potential comes with inherent
challenges in directly training SNNs through spatio-temporal backpropagation --
stemming from the temporal dynamics of spiking neurons and their discrete
signal processing -- which necessitates alternative ways of training, most
notably through ANN-SNN conversion. In this work, we introduce a lightweight
Forward Temporal Bias Correction (FTBC) technique, aimed at enhancing
conversion accuracy without the computational overhead. We ground our method on
provided theoretical findings that through proper temporal bias calibration the
expected error of ANN-SNN conversion can be reduced to be zero after each time
step. We further propose a heuristic algorithm for finding the temporal bias
only in the forward pass, thus eliminating the computational burden of
backpropagation and we evaluate our method on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet
datasets, achieving a notable increase in accuracy on all datasets. Codes are

limitations of supervised learning techniques, which depend heavily on large
volumes of annotated data. The annotation process is not only costly but also
demands substantial time from clinical specialists. Addressing this issue, we
introduce the S4MI (Self-Supervision and Semi-Supervision for Medical Imaging)
pipeline, a novel approach that leverages advancements in self-supervised and
semi-supervised learning. These techniques engage in auxiliary tasks that do
not require labeling, thus simplifying the scaling of machine supervision
compared to fully-supervised methods. Our study benchmarks these techniques on
three distinct medical imaging datasets to evaluate their effectiveness in
classification and segmentation tasks. Notably, we observed that self
supervised learning significantly surpassed the performance of supervised
methods in the classification of all evaluated datasets. Remarkably, the
semi-supervised approach demonstrated superior outcomes in segmentation,
outperforming fully-supervised methods while using 50% fewer labels across all
datasets. In line with our commitment to contributing to the scientific
community, we have made the S4MI code openly accessible, allowing for broader
application and further development of these methods.

                                        <span>  Detecting objects in low-light scenarios presents a persistent challenge, as
detectors trained on well-lit data exhibit significant performance degradation
on low-light data due to low visibility. Previous methods mitigate this issue
by exploring image enhancement or object detection techniques with real
low-light image datasets. However, the progress is impeded by the inherent
difficulties about collecting and annotating low-light images. To address this
challenge, we propose to boost low-light object detection with zero-shot
day-night domain adaptation, which aims to generalize a detector from well-lit
scenarios to low-light ones without requiring real low-light data. Revisiting
Retinex theory in the low-level vision, we first design a reflectance
representation learning module to learn Retinex-based illumination invariance
in images with a carefully designed illumination invariance reinforcement
strategy. Next, an interchange-redecomposition-coherence procedure is
introduced to improve over the vanilla Retinex image decomposition process by
performing two sequential image decompositions and introducing a
redecomposition cohering loss. Extensive experiments on ExDark, DARK FACE, and
CODaN datasets show strong low-light generalizability of our method. Our code

                                        <span>  Diffusion models have recently gained traction as a powerful class of deep
generative priors, excelling in a wide range of image restoration tasks due to
their exceptional ability to model data distributions. To solve image
restoration problems, many existing techniques achieve data consistency by
incorporating additional likelihood gradient steps into the reverse sampling
process of diffusion models. However, the additional gradient steps pose a
challenge for real-world practical applications as they incur a large
computational overhead, thereby increasing inference time. They also present
additional difficulties when using accelerated diffusion model samplers, as the
number of data consistency steps is limited by the number of reverse sampling
steps. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based image restoration
solver that addresses these issues by decoupling the reverse process from the
data consistency steps. Our method involves alternating between a
reconstruction phase to maintain data consistency and a refinement phase that
enforces the prior via diffusion purification. Our approach demonstrates
versatility, making it highly adaptable for efficient problem-solving in latent
space. Additionally, it reduces the necessity for numerous sampling steps
through the integration of consistency models. The efficacy of our approach is
validated through comprehensive experiments across various image restoration
tasks, including image denoising, deblurring, inpainting, and super-resolution.

stay, is a highly prominent machine learning task in medical and healthcare
applications. However, only a few interpretable machine learning methods comply
with its challenges. To facilitate a comprehensive explanatory analysis of
survival models, we formally introduce time-dependent feature effects and
global feature importance explanations. We show how post-hoc interpretation
methods allow for finding biases in AI systems predicting length of stay using
a novel multi-modal dataset created from 1235 X-ray images with textual
radiology reports annotated by human experts. Moreover, we evaluate cancer
survival models beyond predictive performance to include the importance of
multi-omics feature groups based on a large-scale benchmark comprising 11
datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Model developers can use the
proposed methods to debug and improve machine learning algorithms, while
physicians can discover disease biomarkers and assess their significance. We
hope the contributed open data and code resources facilitate future work in the
emerging research direction of explainable survival analysis.

co-occurring salient objects (CoSOD) in image groups without requiring
segmentation annotations. Unlike existing unsupervised methods that rely solely
on patch-level information (e.g. clustering patch descriptors) or on
computation heavy off-the-shelf components for CoSOD, our lightweight model
leverages feature correspondences at both patch and region levels,
significantly improving prediction performance. In the first stage, we train a
self-supervised network that detects co-salient regions by computing local
patch-level feature correspondences across images. We obtain the segmentation
predictions using confidence-based adaptive thresholding. In the next stage, we
refine these intermediate segmentations by eliminating the detected regions
(within each image) whose averaged feature representations are dissimilar to
the foreground feature representation averaged across all the cross-attention
maps (from the previous stage). Extensive experiments on three CoSOD benchmark
datasets show that our self-supervised model outperforms the corresponding
state-of-the-art models by a huge margin (e.g. on the CoCA dataset, our model
has a 13.7% F-measure gain over the SOTA unsupervised CoSOD model). Notably,
our self-supervised model also outperforms several recent fully supervised
CoSOD models on the three test datasets (e.g., on the CoCA dataset, our model
has a 4.6% F-measure gain over a recent supervised CoSOD model).

model named impLicit vIsion prOmpt tuNing (LION), which is motivated by deep
implicit models with stable memory costs for various complex tasks. In
particular, we merely insect two equilibrium implicit layers in two ends of the
pre-trained main backbone with parameters in the backbone frozen. Moreover, we
prune the parameters in these two layers according to lottery hypothesis. The
performance obtained by our LION are promising on a wide range of datasets. In
particular, our LION reduces up to 11.5% of training parameter numbers while
obtaining higher performance compared with the state-of-the-art baseline VPT,
especially under challenging scenes. Furthermore, we find that our proposed
LION had a good generalization performance, making it an easy way to boost
transfer learning in the future.

                                        <span>  Visual learning often occurs in a specific context, where an agent acquires
skills through exploration and tracking of its location in a consistent
environment. The historical spatial context of the agent provides a similarity
signal for self-supervised contrastive learning. We present a unique approach,
termed Environmental Spatial Similarity (ESS), that complements existing
contrastive learning methods. Using images from simulated, photorealistic
environments as an experimental setting, we demonstrate that ESS outperforms
traditional instance discrimination approaches. Moreover, sampling additional
data from the same environment substantially improves accuracy and provides new
augmentations. ESS allows remarkable proficiency in room classification and
spatial prediction tasks, especially in unfamiliar environments. This learning
paradigm has the potential to enable rapid visual learning in agents operating
in new environments with unique visual characteristics. Potentially
transformative applications span from robotics to space exploration. Our proof
of concept demonstrates improved efficiency over methods that rely on
extensive, disconnected datasets.

data and test data are from the same distribution. Open-set semi-supervised
learning (Open-set SSL) considers a more practical scenario, where unlabeled
data and test data contain new categories (outliers) not observed in labeled
data (inliers). Most previous works focused on outlier detection via binary
classifiers, which suffer from insufficient scalability and inability to
distinguish different types of uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework, Adaptive Negative Evidential Deep Learning (ANEDL) to tackle these
limitations. Concretely, we first introduce evidential deep learning (EDL) as
an outlier detector to quantify different types of uncertainty, and design
different uncertainty metrics for self-training and inference. Furthermore, we
propose a novel adaptive negative optimization strategy, making EDL more
tailored to the unlabeled dataset containing both inliers and outliers. As
demonstrated empirically, our proposed method outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods across four datasets.

States, with the lifetime risk for developing this disease is approximately
2.8% in women. Precise histologic evaluation and molecular classification of
endometrial cancer is important for effective patient management and
determining the best treatment modalities. This study introduces EndoNet, which
uses convolutional neural networks for extracting histologic features and a
vision transformer for aggregating these features and classifying slides based
on their visual characteristics into high- and low- grade. The model was
trained on 929 digitized hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole-slide images of
endometrial cancer from hysterectomy cases at Dartmouth-Health. It classifies
these slides into low-grade (Endometroid Grades 1 and 2) and high-grade
(endometroid carcinoma FIGO grade 3, uterine serous carcinoma, carcinosarcoma)
categories. EndoNet was evaluated on an internal test set of 110 patients and
an external test set of 100 patients from the public TCGA database. The model
achieved a weighted average F1-score of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.86-0.95) and an AUC of
0.95 (95% CI: 0.89-0.99) on the internal test, and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.80-0.94) for
F1-score and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.75-0.93) for AUC on the external test. Pending
further validation, EndoNet has the potential to support pathologists without
the need of manual annotations in classifying the grades of gynecologic
pathology tumors.

Traditional data collection methods for these diagrams have limitations in
terms of temporal and spatial coverage. Recent advancements in camera
technology have overcome these limitations and provided extensive urban data.
In this study, we propose an innovative approach to constructing time-space
diagrams by utilizing street-view video sequences captured by cameras mounted
on moving vehicles. Using the state-of-the-art YOLOv5, StrongSORT, and
photogrammetry techniques for distance calculation, we can infer vehicle
trajectories from the video data and generate time-space diagrams. To evaluate
the effectiveness of our proposed method, we utilized datasets from the KITTI
computer vision benchmark suite. The evaluation results demonstrate that our
approach can generate trajectories from video data, although there are some
errors that can be mitigated by improving the performance of the detector,
tracker, and distance calculation components. In conclusion, the utilization of
street-view video sequences captured by cameras mounted on moving vehicles,
combined with state-of-the-art computer vision techniques, has immense

sensors with different modalities is crucial to ensure high operational
precision and stability. To correctly exploit the provided information by each
sensor in a single common frame, it is essential for these sensors to be
accurately calibrated. In this paper, we leverage the ability of Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) to represent different sensors modalities in a common
volumetric representation to achieve robust and accurate spatio-temporal sensor
calibration. By designing a partitioning approach based on the visible part of
the scene for each sensor, we formulate the calibration problem using only the
overlapping areas. This strategy results in a more robust and accurate
calibration that is less prone to failure. We demonstrate that our approach
works on outdoor urban scenes by validating it on multiple established driving
datasets. Results show that our method is able to get better accuracy and
robustness compared to existing methods.

three steps: point, segment, and count. Specifically, we first propose a
class-agnostic object localization to provide accurate but least point prompts
for SAM, which consequently not only reduces computation costs but also avoids
missing small objects. Furthermore, we propose a generalized object
classification that leverages CLIP image/text embeddings as the classifier,
following a hierarchical knowledge distillation to obtain discriminative
classifications among hierarchical mask proposals. Extensive experimental
results on FSC-147, COCO, and LVIS demonstrate that PseCo achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both few-shot/zero-shot object
counting/detection. Code: https://github.com/Hzzone/PseCo

avatar animation in human-machine interaction applications. While the existing
methods enable generating the gestures to follow a single emotion label, they
overlook that long gesture sequence modeling with emotion transition is more
practical in real scenes. In addition, the lack of large-scale available
datasets with emotional transition speech and corresponding 3D human gestures
also limits the addressing of this task. To fulfill this goal, we first
incorporate the ChatGPT-4 and an audio inpainting approach to construct the
high-fidelity emotion transition human speeches. Considering obtaining the
realistic 3D pose annotations corresponding to the dynamically inpainted
emotion transition audio is extremely difficult, we propose a novel weakly
supervised training strategy to encourage authority gesture transitions.
Specifically, to enhance the coordination of transition gestures w.r.t
different emotional ones, we model the temporal association representation
between two different emotional gesture sequences as style guidance and infuse
it into the transition generation. We further devise an emotion mixture
mechanism that provides weak supervision based on a learnable mixed emotion
label for transition gestures. Last, we present a keyframe sampler to supply
effective initial posture cues in long sequences, enabling us to generate
diverse gestures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
the state-of-the-art models constructed by adapting single emotion-conditioned
counterparts on our newly defined emotion transition task and datasets. Our
code and dataset will be released on the project page:

shifts between training and test scenarios. For a new in-distribution (ID)
dataset, existing methods require retraining to capture the dataset-specific
feature representation or data distribution. In this paper, we propose a deep
generative models (DGM) based transferable OOD detection method, which is
unnecessary to retrain on a new ID dataset. We design an image erasing strategy
to equip exclusive conditional entropy distribution for each ID dataset, which
determines the discrepancy of DGM's posteriori ucertainty distribution on
different ID datasets. Owing to the powerful representation capacity of
convolutional neural networks, the proposed model trained on complex dataset
can capture the above discrepancy between ID datasets without retraining and
thus achieve transferable OOD detection. We validate the proposed method on
five datasets and verity that ours achieves comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art group based OOD detection methods that need to be retrained to
deploy on new ID datasets. Our code is available at

                                        <span>  Semi-supervised image segmentation has attracted great attention recently.
The key is how to leverage unlabeled images in the training process. Most
methods maintain consistent predictions of the unlabeled images under
variations (e.g., adding noise/perturbations, or creating alternative versions)
in the image and/or model level. In most image-level variation, medical images
often have prior structure information, which has not been well explored. In
this paper, we propose novel dual structure-aware image filterings (DSAIF) as
the image-level variations for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.
Motivated by connected filtering that simplifies image via filtering in
structure-aware tree-based image representation, we resort to the dual contrast
invariant Max-tree and Min-tree representation. Specifically, we propose a
novel connected filtering that removes topologically equivalent nodes (i.e.
connected components) having no siblings in the Max/Min-tree. This results in
two filtered images preserving topologically critical structure. Applying the
proposed DSAIF to mutually supervised networks decreases the consensus of their
erroneous predictions on unlabeled images. This helps to alleviate the
confirmation bias issue of overfitting to noisy pseudo labels of unlabeled
images, and thus effectively improves the segmentation performance. Extensive
experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method significantly/consistently outperforms some state-of-the-art methods.
The source codes will be publicly available.

research, enabling zero-shot pathological recognition by comparing the query
image with the textual descriptions for each disease. Due to the complex
semantics of biomedical texts, current methods struggle to align medical images
with key pathological findings in unstructured reports. This leads to the
misalignment with the target disease's textual representation. In this paper,
we introduce a novel VLP framework designed to dissect disease descriptions
into their fundamental aspects, leveraging prior knowledge about the visual
manifestations of pathologies. This is achieved by consulting a large language
model and medical experts. Integrating a Transformer module, our approach
aligns an input image with the diverse elements of a disease, generating
aspect-centric image representations. By consolidating the matches from each
aspect, we improve the compatibility between an image and its associated
disease. Additionally, capitalizing on the aspect-oriented representations, we
present a dual-head Transformer tailored to process known and unknown diseases,
optimizing the comprehensive detection efficacy. Conducting experiments on
seven downstream datasets, ours improves the accuracy of recent methods by up
to 8.56% and 17.0% for seen and unseen categories, respectively. Our code is

pretrained StyleGAN, where a multi-scale mask-guided encoder is applied to
project the texture of each facial component into regional style codes and a
mask-guided injection module manipulating feature maps with the style codes.
Based on this disentanglement, face swapping can be simplified as style and
mask swapping. Besides, due to the large lighting condition gap, transferring
the source skin into the target image may lead to disharmony lighting. We
propose a re-coloring network to make the swapped face maintain the target
lighting condition while preserving the source skin. Further, to deal with the
potential mismatch areas during mask exchange, we design a face inpainting
module to refine the face shape. The extensive comparisons with
state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that our E4S outperforms existing methods
in preserving texture, shape, and lighting. Our implementation is available at

                                        <span>  Since real-world machine systems are running in non-stationary environments,
Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) task is proposed to adapt the pre-trained
model to continually changing target domains. Recently, existing methods mainly
focus on model-based adaptation, which aims to leverage a self-training manner
to extract the target domain knowledge. However, pseudo labels can be noisy and
the updated model parameters are unreliable under dynamic data distributions,
leading to error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting in the continual
adaptation process. To tackle these challenges and maintain the model
plasticity, we design a Visual Domain Adapter (ViDA) for CTTA, explicitly
handling both domain-specific and domain-shared knowledge. Specifically, we
first comprehensively explore the different domain representations of the
adapters with trainable high-rank or low-rank embedding spaces. Then we inject
ViDAs into the pre-trained model, which leverages high-rank and low-rank
features to adapt the current domain distribution and maintain the continual
domain-shared knowledge, respectively. To exploit the low-rank and high-rank
ViDAs more effectively, we further propose a Homeostatic Knowledge Allotment
(HKA) strategy, which adaptively combines different knowledge from each ViDA.
Extensive experiments conducted on four widely used benchmarks demonstrate that
our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
classification and segmentation CTTA tasks. Note that, our method can be
regarded as a novel transfer paradigm for large-scale models, delivering
promising results in adaptation to continually changing distributions. Project

                                        <span>  Prior study shows that pre-training techniques can boost the performance of
visual document understanding (VDU), which typically requires models to gain
abilities to perceive and reason both document texts and layouts (e.g.,
locations of texts and table-cells). To this end, we propose visually guided
generative text-layout pre-training, named ViTLP. Given a document image, the
model optimizes hierarchical language and layout modeling objectives to
generate the interleaved text and layout sequence. In addition, to address the
limitation of processing long documents by Transformers, we introduce a
straightforward yet effective multi-segment generative pre-training scheme,
facilitating ViTLP to process word-intensive documents of any length. ViTLP can
function as a native OCR model to localize and recognize texts of document
images. Besides, ViTLP can be effectively applied to various downstream VDU
tasks. Extensive experiments show that ViTLP achieves competitive performance
over existing baselines on benchmark VDU tasks, including information
extraction, document classification, and document question answering.

                                        <span>  Surgical decisions are informed by aligning rapid portable 2D intraoperative
images (e.g., X-rays) to a high-fidelity 3D preoperative reference scan (e.g.,
CT). 2D/3D image registration often fails in practice: conventional
optimization methods are prohibitively slow and susceptible to local minima,
while neural networks trained on small datasets fail on new patients or require
impractical landmark supervision. We present DiffPose, a self-supervised
approach that leverages patient-specific simulation and differentiable
physics-based rendering to achieve accurate 2D/3D registration without relying
on manually labeled data. Preoperatively, a CNN is trained to regress the pose
of a randomly oriented synthetic X-ray rendered from the preoperative CT. The
CNN then initializes rapid intraoperative test-time optimization that uses the
differentiable X-ray renderer to refine the solution. Our work further proposes
several geometrically principled methods for sampling camera poses from
$\mathbf{SE}(3)$, for sparse differentiable rendering, and for driving
registration in the tangent space $\mathfrak{se}(3)$ with geodesic and
multiscale locality-sensitive losses. DiffPose achieves sub-millimeter accuracy
across surgical datasets at intraoperative speeds, improving upon existing
unsupervised methods by an order of magnitude and even outperforming supervised
baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/eigenvivek/DiffPose.

                                        <span>  While multi-task learning (MTL) has gained significant attention in recent
years, its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Recent methods did
not yield consistent performance improvements over single task learning (STL)
baselines, underscoring the importance of gaining more profound insights about
challenges specific to MTL. In our study, we challenge paradigms in MTL in the
context of STL: First, the impact of the choice of optimizer has only been
mildly investigated in MTL. We show the pivotal role of common STL tools such
as the Adam optimizer in MTL empirically in various experiments. To further
investigate Adam's effectiveness, we theoretical derive a partial loss-scale
invariance under mild assumptions. Second, the notion of gradient conflicts has
often been phrased as a specific problem in MTL. We delve into the role of
gradient conflicts in MTL and compare it to STL. For angular gradient alignment
we find no evidence that this is a unique problem in MTL. We emphasize
differences in gradient magnitude as the main distinguishing factor. Lastly, we
compare the transferability of features learned through MTL and STL on common
image corruptions, and find light evidence that MTL can lead to superior
transferability. Overall, we find surprising similarities between STL and MTL
suggesting to consider methods from both fields in a broader context.

of physical variables at different spatial locations in large 3D simulation
ensembles. Going beyond linear dependencies, we consider mutual information as
a measure of non-linear dependence. We demonstrate learning and reconstruction
with a large weather forecast ensemble comprising 1000 members, each storing
multiple physical variables at a 250 x 352 x 20 simulation grid. By
circumventing compute-intensive statistical estimators at runtime, we
demonstrate significantly reduced memory and computation requirements for
reconstructing the major dependence structures. This enables embedding the
estimator into a GPU-accelerated direct volume renderer and interactively
visualizing all mutual dependencies for a selected domain point.

SAR-Net, a novel framework specifically designed for global fusion of
direction-aware information in SAR object detection. SAR-Net leverages two key
innovations: the Unity Compensation Mechanism (UCM) and the Direction-aware
Attention Module (DAM). UCM facilitates the establishment of complementary
relationships among features across different scales, enabling efficient global
information fusion. Among them, Multi-scale Alignment Module (MAM) and distinct
Multi-level Fusion Module (MFM) enhance feature integration by capturing both
texture detail and semantic information. Then, Multi-feature Embedding Module
(MEM) feeds back global features into the primary branches, further improving
information transmission. Additionally, DAM, through bidirectional attention
polymerization, captures direction-aware information, effectively eliminating
background interference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
SAR-Net, achieving state-of-the-art results on aircraft (SAR-AIRcraft-1.0) and
ship datasets (SSDD, HRSID), confirming its generalization capability and
robustness.

                                        <span>  Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D
human pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video
pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices.
In this paper, we present a plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering framework,
called Hourglass Tokenizer (HoT), for efficient transformer-based 3D human pose
estimation from videos. Our HoT begins with pruning pose tokens of redundant
frames and ends with recovering full-length tokens, resulting in a few pose
tokens in the intermediate transformer blocks and thus improving the model
efficiency. To effectively achieve this, we propose a token pruning cluster
(TPC) that dynamically selects a few representative tokens with high semantic
diversity while eliminating the redundancy of video frames. In addition, we
develop a token recovering attention (TRA) to restore the detailed
spatio-temporal information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the
network output to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast
inference. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (i.e., Human3.6M and
MPI-INF-3DHP) demonstrate that our method can achieve both high efficiency and
estimation accuracy compared to the original VPT models. For instance, applying
to MotionBERT and MixSTE on Human3.6M, our HoT can save nearly 50% FLOPs
without sacrificing accuracy and nearly 40% FLOPs with only 0.2% accuracy drop,
respectively. Code and models are available at

                                        <span>  Layout-to-image synthesis is an emerging technique in conditional image
generation. It aims to generate complex scenes, where users require fine
control over the layout of the objects in a scene. However, it remains
challenging to control the object coherence, including semantic coherence
(e.g., the cat looks at the flowers or not) and physical coherence (e.g., the
hand and the racket should not be misaligned). In this paper, we propose a
novel diffusion model with effective global semantic fusion (GSF) and
self-similarity feature enhancement modules to guide the object coherence for
this task. For semantic coherence, we argue that the image caption contains
rich information for defining the semantic relationship within the objects in
the images. Instead of simply employing cross-attention between captions and
generated images, which addresses the highly relevant layout restriction and
semantic coherence separately and thus leads to unsatisfying results shown in
our experiments, we develop GSF to fuse the supervision from the layout
restriction and semantic coherence requirement and exploit it to guide the
image synthesis process. Moreover, to improve the physical coherence, we
develop a Self-similarity Coherence Attention (SCA) module to explicitly
integrate local contextual physical coherence into each pixel's generation
process. Specifically, we adopt a self-similarity map to encode the coherence
restrictions and employ it to extract coherent features from text embedding.
Through visualization of our self-similarity map, we explore the essence of
SCA, revealing that its effectiveness is not only in capturing reliable
physical coherence patterns but also in enhancing complex texture generation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in
both image generation quality and controllability.

in autonomous driving. Recent works mainly focus on improving efficiency or
accuracy but neglect the challenges when facing environment changing, resulting
in severe degradation of transfer performance. For BEV perception, we figure
out the significant domain gaps existing in typical real-world cross-domain
scenarios and comprehensively solve the Domain Adaption (DA) problem for
multi-view 3D object detection. Since BEV perception approaches are complicated
and contain several components, the domain shift accumulation on multiple
geometric spaces (i.e., 2D, 3D Voxel, BEV) makes BEV DA even challenging. In
this paper, we propose a Multi-space Alignment Teacher-Student (MATS) framework
to ease the domain shift accumulation, which consists of a Depth-Aware Teacher
(DAT) and a Geometric-space Aligned Student (GAS) model. DAT tactfully combines
target lidar and reliable depth prediction to construct depth-aware
information, extracting target domain-specific knowledge in Voxel and BEV
feature spaces. It then transfers the sufficient domain knowledge of multiple
spaces to the student model. In order to jointly alleviate the domain shift,
GAS projects multi-geometric space features to a shared geometric embedding
space and decreases data distribution distance between two domains. To verify
the effectiveness of our method, we conduct BEV 3D object detection experiments
on three cross-domain scenarios and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

years, so-called foundation models have become popular in NLP and vision tasks.
In this work, we propose to explore foundation models for the task of keypoint
detection on 3D shapes. A unique characteristic of keypoint detection is that
it requires semantic and geometric awareness while demanding high localization
accuracy. To address this problem, we propose, first, to back-project features
from large pre-trained 2D vision models onto 3D shapes and employ them for this
task. We show that we obtain robust 3D features that contain rich semantic
information and analyze multiple candidate features stemming from different 2D
foundation models. Second, we employ a keypoint candidate optimization module
which aims to match the average observed distribution of keypoints on the shape
and is guided by the back-projected features. The resulting approach achieves a
new state of the art for few-shot keypoint detection on the KeyPointNet
dataset, almost doubling the performance of the previous best methods.

the lack of 4D labeled data. Extending image-to-3D pipelines by transferring
off-the-shelf image generation models such as score distillation sampling,
existing methods tend to be slow and expensive to scale due to the need for
back-propagating the information-limited supervision signals through a large
pretrained model. To address this, we propose an efficient video-to-4D object
generation framework called Efficient4D. It generates high-quality
spacetime-consistent images under different camera views, and then uses them as
labeled data to directly train a novel 4D Gaussian splatting model with
explicit point cloud geometry, enabling real-time rendering under continuous
camera trajectories. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real videos show
that Efficient4D offers a remarkable 20-fold increase in speed when compared to
prior art alternatives while preserving the quality of novel view synthesis.
For example, Efficient4D takes only 6 mins to model a dynamic object, vs 120
mins by Consistent4D.

transferred to other datasets. However, enlarging data size and diversity can
substantially improve performance, leading to a new state-of-the-art result for

                                        <span>  The popular CLIP model displays impressive zero-shot capabilities thanks to
its seamless interaction with arbitrary text prompts. However, its lack of
spatial awareness makes it unsuitable for dense computer vision tasks, e.g.,
semantic segmentation, without an additional fine-tuning step that often uses
annotations and can potentially suppress its original open-vocabulary
properties. Meanwhile, self-supervised representation methods have demonstrated
good localization properties without human-made annotations nor explicit
supervision. In this work, we take the best of both worlds and propose an
open-vocabulary semantic segmentation method, which does not require any
annotations. We propose to locally improve dense MaskCLIP features, which are
computed with a simple modification of CLIP's last pooling layer, by
integrating localization priors extracted from self-supervised features. By
doing so, we greatly improve the performance of MaskCLIP and produce smooth
outputs. Moreover, we show that the used self-supervised feature properties can
directly be learnt from CLIP features. Our method CLIP-DINOiser needs only a
single forward pass of CLIP and two light convolutional layers at inference, no
extra supervision nor extra memory and reaches state-of-the-art results on
challenging and fine-grained benchmarks such as COCO, Pascal Context,
Cityscapes and ADE20k. The code to reproduce our results is available at

                                        <span>  Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) is proposed to migrate a source
pre-trained model to continually changing target distributions, addressing
real-world dynamism. Existing CTTA methods mainly rely on entropy minimization
or teacher-student pseudo-labeling schemes for knowledge extraction in
unlabeled target domains. However, dynamic data distributions cause
miscalibrated predictions and noisy pseudo-labels in existing self-supervised
learning methods, hindering the effective mitigation of error accumulation and
catastrophic forgetting problems during the continual adaptation process. To
tackle these issues, we propose a continual self-supervised method, Adaptive
Distribution Masked Autoencoders (ADMA), which enhances the extraction of
target domain knowledge while mitigating the accumulation of distribution
shifts. Specifically, we propose a Distribution-aware Masking (DaM) mechanism
to adaptively sample masked positions, followed by establishing consistency
constraints between the masked target samples and the original target samples.
Additionally, for masked tokens, we utilize an efficient decoder to reconstruct
a hand-crafted feature descriptor (e.g., Histograms of Oriented Gradients),
leveraging its invariant properties to boost task-relevant representations.
Through conducting extensive experiments on four widely recognized benchmarks,
our proposed method attains state-of-the-art performance in both classification
and segmentation CTTA tasks. Our project page:

segmentation from different image modalities. Existing state-of-the-art methods
focus on a single modality, despite the wide range of available cerebrovascular
imaging techniques. This can lead to significant distribution shifts that
negatively impact the generalization across modalities. By relying on annotated
angiographies and a limited number of annotated venographies, our framework
accomplishes image-to-image translation and semantic segmentation, leveraging a
disentangled and semantically rich latent space to represent heterogeneous data
and perform image-level adaptation from source to target domains. Moreover, we
reduce the typical complexity of cycle-based architectures and minimize the use
of adversarial training, which allows us to build an efficient and intuitive
model with stable training. We evaluate our method on magnetic resonance
angiographies and venographies. While achieving state-of-the-art performance in
the source domain, our method attains a Dice score coefficient in the target
domain that is only 8.9% lower, highlighting its promising potential for robust
cerebrovascular image segmentation across different modalities.

                                        <span>  In the realms of computer vision and natural language processing, Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have become indispensable tools, proficient in
generating textual descriptions based on visual inputs. Despite their
advancements, our investigation reveals a noteworthy bias in the generated
content, where the output is primarily influenced by the underlying Large
Language Models (LLMs) prior rather than the input image. Our empirical
experiments underscore the persistence of this bias, as LVLMs often provide
confident answers even in the absence of relevant images or given incongruent
visual input. To rectify these biases and redirect the model's focus toward
vision information, we introduce two simple, training-free strategies. Firstly,
for tasks such as classification or multi-choice question-answering (QA), we
propose a ``calibration'' step through affine transformation to adjust the
output distribution. This ``Post-Hoc debias'' approach ensures uniform scores
for each answer when the image is absent, serving as an effective
regularization technique to alleviate the influence of LLM priors. For more
intricate open-ended generation tasks, we extend this method to ``Debias
sampling'', drawing inspirations from contrastive decoding methods.
Furthermore, our investigation sheds light on the instability of LVLMs across
various decoding configurations. Through systematic exploration of different
settings, we significantly enhance performance, surpassing reported results and
raising concerns about the fairness of existing evaluations. Comprehensive
experiments substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed strategies in
mitigating biases. These strategies not only prove beneficial in minimizing
hallucinations but also contribute to the generation of more helpful and
precise illustrations.

in the generation of high-quality images. In combination with Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRFs), they enabled new opportunities in 3D generation. However, most
generative 3D approaches are object-centric and applying them to editing
existing photorealistic scenes is not trivial. We propose SIGNeRF, a novel
approach for fast and controllable NeRF scene editing and scene-integrated
object generation. A new generative update strategy ensures 3D consistency
across the edited images, without requiring iterative optimization. We find
that depth-conditioned diffusion models inherently possess the capability to
generate 3D consistent views by requesting a grid of images instead of single
views. Based on these insights, we introduce a multi-view reference sheet of
modified images. Our method updates an image collection consistently based on
the reference sheet and refines the original NeRF with the newly generated
image set in one go. By exploiting the depth conditioning mechanism of the
image diffusion model, we gain fine control over the spatial location of the
edit and enforce shape guidance by a selected region or an external mesh.

threaten the security of video recognition systems. Attackers can invade such
models with a low query budget when the perturbations are semantic-invariant,
such as StyleFool. Despite the query efficiency, the naturalness of the minutia
areas still requires amelioration, since StyleFool leverages style transfer to
all pixels in each frame. To close the gap, we propose LocalStyleFool, an
improved black-box video adversarial attack that superimposes regional
style-transfer-based perturbations on videos. Benefiting from the popularity
and scalably usability of Segment Anything Model (SAM), we first extract
different regions according to semantic information and then track them through
the video stream to maintain the temporal consistency. Then, we add
style-transfer-based perturbations to several regions selected based on the
associative criterion of transfer-based gradient information and regional area.
Perturbation fine adjustment is followed to make stylized videos adversarial.
We demonstrate that LocalStyleFool can improve both intra-frame and inter-frame
naturalness through a human-assessed survey, while maintaining competitive
fooling rate and query efficiency. Successful experiments on the
high-resolution dataset also showcase that scrupulous segmentation of SAM helps
to improve the scalability of adversarial attacks under high-resolution data.

                                        <span>  LiDAR Upsampling is a challenging task for the perception systems of robots
and autonomous vehicles, due to the sparse and irregular structure of
large-scale scene contexts. Recent works propose to solve this problem by
converting LiDAR data from 3D Euclidean space into an image super-resolution
problem in 2D image space. Although their methods can generate high-resolution
range images with fine-grained details, the resulting 3D point clouds often
blur out details and predict invalid points. In this paper, we propose TULIP, a
new method to reconstruct high-resolution LiDAR point clouds from
low-resolution LiDAR input. We also follow a range image-based approach but
specifically modify the patch and window geometries of a Swin-Transformer-based
network to better fit the characteristics of range images. We conducted several
experiments on three public real-world and simulated datasets. TULIP
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in all relevant metrics and generates
robust and more realistic point clouds than prior works.

the conventional Big-means methodology. The proposed method efficiently
integrates parallel processing, stochastic sampling, and competitive
optimization to create a scalable variant designed for big data applications.
It addresses scalability and computation time challenges typically faced with
traditional techniques. The algorithm adjusts sample sizes dynamically for each
worker during execution, optimizing performance. Data from these sample sizes
are continually analyzed, facilitating the identification of the most efficient
configuration. By incorporating a competitive element among workers using
different sample sizes, efficiency within the Big-means algorithm is further
stimulated. In essence, the algorithm balances computational time and
clustering quality by employing a stochastic, competitive sampling strategy in

                                        <span>  Scaling up neural models has yielded significant advancements in a wide array
of tasks, particularly in language generation. Previous studies have found that
the performance of neural models frequently adheres to predictable scaling
laws, correlated with factors such as training set size and model size. This
insight is invaluable, especially as large-scale experiments grow increasingly
resource-intensive. Yet, such scaling law has not been fully explored in dense
retrieval due to the discrete nature of retrieval metrics and complex
relationships between training data and model sizes in retrieval tasks. In this
study, we investigate whether the performance of dense retrieval models follows
the scaling law as other neural models. We propose to use contrastive
log-likelihood as the evaluation metric and conduct extensive experiments with
dense retrieval models implemented with different numbers of parameters and
trained with different amounts of annotated data. Results indicate that, under
our settings, the performance of dense retrieval models follows a precise
power-law scaling related to the model size and the number of annotations.
Additionally, we examine scaling with prevalent data augmentation methods to
assess the impact of annotation quality, and apply the scaling law to find the
best resource allocation strategy under a budget constraint. We believe that
these insights will significantly contribute to understanding the scaling
effect of dense retrieval models and offer meaningful guidance for future
research endeavors.

diversity in recommendation systems is both crucial and demanding. Many current
solutions leverage knowledge graphs to tackle these issues by combining both
item-based and user-item collaborative signals. A common trend in these
approaches focuses on improving ranking performance at the cost of escalating
model complexity, reducing diversity, and complicating the task. It is
essential to provide recommendations that are both personalized and diverse,
rather than solely relying on achieving high rank-based performance, such as
Click-through Rate, Recall, etc. In this paper, we propose a hybrid multi-task
learning approach, training on user-item and item-item interactions. We apply
item-based contrastive learning on descriptive text, sampling positive and
negative pairs based on item metadata. Our approach allows the model to better
understand the relationships between entities within the knowledge graph by
utilizing semantic information from text. It leads to more accurate, relevant,
and diverse user recommendations and a benefit that extends even to cold-start
users who have few interactions with items. We perform extensive experiments on
two widely used datasets to validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our
findings demonstrate that jointly training user-item interactions and
item-based signals using synopsis text is highly effective. Furthermore, our
results provide evidence that item-based contrastive learning enhances the
quality of entity embeddings, as indicated by metrics such as uniformity and
alignment.

assuming users always require personalized recommendations. However, with the
widely spread of ChatGPT and other chatbots, a more crucial problem in the
context of conversational systems is how to minimize user disruption when we
provide recommendation services for users. While previous research has
extensively explored different user intents in dialogue systems, fewer efforts
are made to investigate whether recommendations should be provided. In this
paper, we formally define the recommendability identification problem, which
aims to determine whether recommendations are necessary in a specific scenario.
First, we propose and define the recommendability identification task, which
investigates the need for recommendations in the current conversational
context. A new dataset is constructed. Subsequently, we discuss and evaluate
the feasibility of leveraging pre-trained language models (PLMs) for
recommendability identification. Finally, through comparative experiments, we
demonstrate that directly employing PLMs with zero-shot results falls short of
meeting the task requirements. Besides, fine-tuning or utilizing soft prompt
techniques yields comparable results to traditional classification methods. Our
work is the first to study recommendability before recommendation and provides
preliminary ways to make it a fundamental component of the future
recommendation system.

Recommender Systems (RS) have emerged as indispensable tools across diverse
domains, particularly travel and tourism. These systems simplify trip planning
by offering personalized recommendations that consider individual preferences
and address broader challenges like seasonality, travel regulations, and
capacity constraints. The intricacies of the tourism domain, characterized by
multiple stakeholders, including consumers, item providers, platforms, and
society, underscore the complexity of achieving balance among diverse
interests. Although previous research has focused on fairness in Tourism
Recommender Systems (TRS) from a multistakeholder perspective, limited work has
focused on generating sustainable recommendations.
  Our paper introduces a novel approach for assigning a sustainability
indicator (SF index) for city trips accessible from the users' starting point,
integrating Co2e analysis, destination popularity, and seasonal demand. Our
methodology involves comprehensive data gathering on transportation modes and
emissions, complemented by analyses of destination popularity and seasonal
demand. A user study validates our index, showcasing its practicality and
efficacy in providing well-rounded and sustainable city trip recommendations.
Our findings contribute significantly to the evolution of responsible tourism
strategies, harmonizing the interests of tourists, local communities, and the
environment while paving the way for future research in responsible and
equitable tourism practices.

limited by the lack of user collaboration and the sparsity problem. To address
these issues, this study proposes a behavior-based recommender system that
leverages customers' natural behaviors, such as browsing and clicking, on
e-commerce platforms. The proposed recommendation system involves clustering
active customers, determining neighborhoods, collecting similar users,
calculating product reputation based on similar users, and recommending
high-reputation products. To overcome the complexity of customer behaviors and
traditional clustering methods, an unsupervised clustering approach based on
product categories is developed to enhance the recommendation methodology. This
study makes notable contributions in several aspects. Firstly, a groundbreaking
behavior-based recommendation methodology is developed, incorporating customer
behavior to generate accurate and tailored recommendations leading to improved
customer satisfaction and engagement. Secondly, an original unsupervised
clustering method, focusing on product categories, enables more precise
clustering and facilitates accurate recommendations. Finally, an approach to
determine neighborhoods for active customers within clusters is established,
ensuring grouping of customers with similar behavioral patterns to enhance
recommendation accuracy and relevance. The proposed recommendation methodology
and clustering method contribute to improved recommendation performance,
offering valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the field of
e-commerce recommendation systems. Additionally, the proposed method
outperforms benchmark methods in experiments conducted using a behavior dataset
from the well-known e-commerce site Alibaba.

                                        <span>  Generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm aimed at
augmenting recommender systems with recent advancements in generative
artificial intelligence. This task has been formulated as a
sequence-to-sequence generation process, wherein the input sequence encompasses
data pertaining to the user's previously interacted items, and the output
sequence denotes the generative identifier for the suggested item. However,
existing generative recommendation approaches still encounter challenges in (i)
effectively integrating user-item collaborative signals and item content
information within a unified generative framework, and (ii) executing an
efficient alignment between content information and collaborative signals.
  In this paper, we introduce content-based collaborative generation for
recommender systems, denoted as ColaRec. To capture collaborative signals, the
generative item identifiers are derived from a pretrained collaborative
filtering model, while the user is represented through the aggregation of
interacted items' content. Subsequently, the aggregated textual description of
items is fed into a language model to encapsulate content information. This
integration enables ColaRec to amalgamate collaborative signals and content
information within an end-to-end framework. Regarding the alignment, we propose
an item indexing task to facilitate the mapping between the content-based
semantic space and the interaction-based collaborative space. Additionally, a
contrastive loss is introduced to ensure that items with similar collaborative
GIDs possess comparable content representations, thereby enhancing alignment.
To validate the efficacy of ColaRec, we conduct experiments on three benchmark
datasets. Empirical results substantiate the superior performance of ColaRec.

                                        <span>  Graph neural networks (GNNs) are currently one of the most performant
collaborative filtering methods. Meanwhile, owing to the use of an embedding
table to represent each user/item as a distinct vector, GNN-based recommenders
have inherited the long-standing defect of parameter inefficiency. As a common
practice for scalable embeddings, parameter sharing enables the use of fewer
embedding vectors (i.e., meta-embeddings). When assigning meta-embeddings, most
existing methods are a heuristically designed, predefined mapping from each
user's/item's ID to the corresponding meta-embedding indexes, thus simplifying
the optimization problem into learning only the meta-embeddings. However, in
the context of GNN-based collaborative filtering, such a fixed mapping omits
the semantic correlations between entities that are evident in the user-item
interaction graph, leading to suboptimal recommendation performance. To this
end, we propose Lightweight Embeddings for Graph Collaborative Filtering
(LEGCF), a parameter-efficient embedding framework dedicated to GNN-based
recommenders. LEGCF innovatively introduces an assignment matrix as an extra
learnable component on top of meta-embeddings. To jointly optimize these two
heavily entangled components, aside from learning the meta-embeddings by
minimizing the recommendation loss, LEGCF further performs efficient assignment
update by enforcing a novel semantic similarity constraint and finding its
closed-form solution based on matrix pseudo-inverse. The meta-embeddings and
assignment matrix are alternately updated, where the latter is sparsified on
the fly to ensure negligible storage overhead. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets have verified LEGCF's smallest trade-off between size and
performance, with consistent accuracy gain over state-of-the-art baselines. The
codebase of LEGCF is available in https://github.com/xurong-liang/LEGCF.

                                        <span>  Recent research demonstrates the effectiveness of using pre-trained language
models for legal case retrieval. Most of the existing works focus on improving
the representation ability for the contextualized embedding of the [CLS] token
and calculate relevance using textual semantic similarity. However, in the
legal domain, textual semantic similarity does not always imply that the cases
are relevant enough. Instead, relevance in legal cases primarily depends on the
similarity of key facts that impact the final judgment. Without proper
treatments, the discriminative ability of learned representations could be
limited since legal cases are lengthy and contain numerous non-key facts. To
this end, we introduce DELTA, a discriminative model designed for legal case
retrieval. The basic idea involves pinpointing key facts in legal cases and
pulling the contextualized embedding of the [CLS] token closer to the key facts
while pushing away from the non-key facts, which can warm up the case embedding
space in an unsupervised manner. To be specific, this study brings the word
alignment mechanism to the contextual masked auto-encoder. First, we leverage
shallow decoders to create information bottlenecks, aiming to enhance the
representation ability. Second, we employ the deep decoder to enable
translation between different structures, with the goal of pinpointing key
facts to enhance discriminative ability. Comprehensive experiments conducted on
publicly available legal benchmarks show that our approach can outperform
existing state-of-the-art methods in legal case retrieval. It provides a new
perspective on the in-depth understanding and processing of legal case
documents.

                                        <span>  Sequential recommender systems predict items that may interest users by
modeling their preferences based on historical interactions. Traditional
sequential recommendation methods rely on capturing implicit collaborative
filtering signals among items. Recent relation-aware sequential recommendation
models have achieved promising performance by explicitly incorporating item
relations into the modeling of user historical sequences, where most relations
are extracted from knowledge graphs. However, existing methods rely on manually
predefined relations and suffer the sparsity issue, limiting the generalization
ability in diverse scenarios with varied item relations. In this paper, we
propose a novel relation-aware sequential recommendation framework with Latent
Relation Discovery (LRD). Different from previous relation-aware models that
rely on predefined rules, we propose to leverage the Large Language Model (LLM)
to provide new types of relations and connections between items. The motivation
is that LLM contains abundant world knowledge, which can be adopted to mine
latent relations of items for recommendation. Specifically, inspired by that
humans can describe relations between items using natural language, LRD
harnesses the LLM that has demonstrated human-like knowledge to obtain language
knowledge representations of items. These representations are fed into a latent
relation discovery module based on the discrete state variational autoencoder
(DVAE). Then the self-supervised relation discovery tasks and recommendation
tasks are jointly optimized. Experimental results on multiple public datasets
demonstrate our proposed latent relations discovery method can be incorporated
with existing relation-aware sequential recommendation models and significantly
improve the performance. Further analysis experiments indicate the
effectiveness and reliability of the discovered latent relations.

                                        <span>  Knowledge-based recommendation models effectively alleviate the data sparsity
issue leveraging the side information in the knowledge graph, and have achieved
considerable performance. Nevertheless, the knowledge graphs used in previous
work, namely metadata-based knowledge graphs, are usually constructed based on
the attributes of items and co-occurring relations (e.g., also buy), in which
the former provides limited information and the latter relies on sufficient
interaction data and still suffers from cold start issue. Common sense, as a
form of knowledge with generality and universality, can be used as a supplement
to the metadata-based knowledge graph and provides a new perspective for
modeling users' preferences. Recently, benefiting from the emergent world
knowledge of the large language model, efficient acquisition of common sense
has become possible. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge-based
recommendation framework incorporating common sense, CSRec, which can be
flexibly coupled to existing knowledge-based methods. Considering the challenge
of the knowledge gap between the common sense-based knowledge graph and
metadata-based knowledge graph, we propose a knowledge fusion approach based on
mutual information maximization theory. Experimental results on public datasets
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the performance of
existing knowledge-based recommendation models.

                                        <span>  When users interact with Recommender Systems (RecSys), current situations,
such as time, location, and environment, significantly influence their
preferences. Situations serve as the background for interactions, where
relationships between users and items evolve with situation changes. However,
existing RecSys treat situations, users, and items on the same level. They can
only model the relations between situations and users/items respectively,
rather than the dynamic impact of situations on user-item associations (i.e.,
user preferences). In this paper, we provide a new perspective that takes
situations as the preconditions for users' interactions. This perspective
allows us to separate situations from user/item representations, and capture
situations' influences over the user-item relationship, offering a more
comprehensive understanding of situations. Based on it, we propose a novel
Situation-Aware Recommender Enhancer (SARE), a pluggable module to integrate
situations into various existing RecSys. Since users' perception of situations
and situations' impact on preferences are both personalized, SARE includes a
Personalized Situation Fusion (PSF) and a User-Conditioned Preference Encoder
(UCPE) to model the perception and impact of situations, respectively. We
conduct experiments of applying SARE on seven backbones in various settings on
two real-world datasets. Experimental results indicate that SARE improves the
recommendation performances significantly compared with backbones and SOTA
situation-aware baselines.

to deal with information overload. Although there are numerous studies on
recommender systems for movies, music, and e-commerce, comparatively less
attention has been paid to the recommender system for NFTs despite the
continuous growth of the NFT market. This paper presents a recommender system
for NFTs that utilizes a variety of data sources, from NFT transaction records
to external item features, to generate precise recommendations that cater to
individual preferences. We develop a data-efficient graph-based recommender
system to efficiently capture the complex relationship between each item and
users and generate node(item) embeddings which incorporate both node feature
information and graph structure. Furthermore, we exploit inputs beyond
user-item interactions, such as image feature, text feature, and price feature.
Numerical experiments verify the performance of the graph-based recommender
system improves significantly after utilizing all types of item features as
side information, thereby outperforming all other baselines.

                                        <span>  Recommendation systems (RS) are an increasingly relevant area for both
academic and industry researchers, given their widespread impact on the daily
online experiences of billions of users. One common issue in real RS is the
cold-start problem, where users and items may not contain enough information to
produce high-quality recommendations. This work focuses on a complementary
problem: recommending new users and items unseen (out-of-vocabulary, or OOV) at
training time. This setting is known as the inductive setting and is especially
problematic for factorization-based models, which rely on encoding only those
users/items seen at training time with fixed parameter vectors. Many existing
solutions applied in practice are often naive, such as assigning OOV
users/items to random buckets. In this work, we tackle this problem and propose
approaches that better leverage available user/item features to improve OOV
handling at the embedding table level. We discuss general-purpose plug-and-play
approaches that are easily applicable to most RS models and improve inductive
performance without negatively impacting transductive model performance. We
extensively evaluate 9 OOV embedding methods on 5 models across 4 datasets
(spanning different domains). One of these datasets is a proprietary production
dataset from a prominent RS employed by a large social platform serving
hundreds of millions of daily active users. In our experiments, we find that
several proposed methods that exploit feature similarity using LSH consistently
outperform alternatives on most model-dataset combinations, with the best
method showing a mean improvement of 3.74% over the industry standard baseline
in inductive performance. We release our code and hope our work helps
practitioners make more informed decisions when handling OOV for their RS and
further inspires academic research into improving OOV support in RS.

learning communities, such as natural language processing (NLP), computer
vision (CV) and information retrieval (IR). Transformer architecture's core
mechanism -- attention requires $O(n^2)$ time complexity in training and $O(n)$
time complexity in inference. Many works have been proposed to improve the
attention mechanism's scalability, such as Flash Attention and Multi-query
Attention. A different line of work aims to design new mechanisms to replace
attention. Recently, a notable model structure -- Mamba, which is based on
state space models, has achieved transformer-equivalent performance in multiple
sequence modeling tasks.
  In this work, we examine \mamba's efficacy through the lens of a classical IR
task -- document ranking. A reranker model takes a query and a document as
input, and predicts a scalar relevance score. This task demands the language
model's ability to comprehend lengthy contextual inputs and to capture the
interaction between query and document tokens. We find that (1) Mamba models
achieve competitive performance compared to transformer-based models with the
same training recipe; (2) but also have a lower training throughput in
comparison to efficient transformer implementations such as flash attention. We
hope this study can serve as a starting point to explore Mamba models in other
classical IR tasks. Our code implementation and trained checkpoints are made
public to facilitate
reproducibility.\footnote{https://github.com/zhichaoxu-shufe/RankMamba}.

                                        <span>  Recent years have witnessed extensive researches on developing two tower
recommendation models for relieving information overload. Four building modules
can be identified in such models, namely, user-item encoding, negative
sampling, loss computing and back-propagation updating. To the best of our
knowledge, existing algorithms have researched only on the first three modules,
yet neglecting the backpropagation module. They all adopt a kind of two
backpropagation strategy, which are based on an implicit assumption of equally
treating users and items in the training phase. In this paper, we challenge
such an equal training assumption and propose a novel one backpropagation
updating strategy, which keeps the normal gradient backpropagation for the item
encoding tower, but cuts off the backpropagation for the user encoding tower.
Instead, we propose a moving-aggregation updating strategy to update a user
encoding in each training epoch. Except the proposed backpropagation updating
module, we implement the other three modules with the most straightforward
choices. Experiments on four public datasets validate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our model in terms of improved recommendation performance and
reduced computation overload over the state-of-the-art competitors.

through its visual eloquence. Authors utilize aesthetic elements such as
colors, fonts, graphics, and layouts to shape the perception of information.
Thoughtful document design, informed by psychological insights, enhances both
the visual appeal and the comprehension of the content. While state-of-the-art
document AI models demonstrate the benefits of incorporating layout and image
data, it remains unclear whether the nuances of document aesthetics are
effectively captured. To bridge the gap between human cognition and AI
interpretation of aesthetic elements, we formulated hypotheses concerning AI
behavior in document understanding tasks, specifically anchored in document
design principles. With a focus on legibility and layout quality, we tested
four aspects of aesthetic effects: noise, font-size contrast, alignment, and
complexity, on model confidence using correlational analysis. The results and
observations highlight the value of model analysis rooted in document design
theories. Our work serves as a trailhead for further studies and we advocate
for continued research in this topic to deepen our understanding of how AI
interprets document aesthetics.

significant in the rapidly developing human-computer interaction research in
the literature review process. Our paper introduces and analyses a new
information retrieval system using state-of-the-art Large Language Models
(LLMs) in combination with structured text analysis techniques to extract
experimental data from HCI literature, emphasizing key elements. Then We
analyze the challenges and risks of using LLMs in the world of research. We
performed a comprehensive analysis on our conducted dataset, which contained
the specified information of 300 CHI 2020-2022 papers, to evaluate the
performance of the two large language models, GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and
Llama-2-70b, paired with structured text analysis techniques. The GPT-3.5 model
gains an accuracy of 58\% and a mean absolute error of 7.00. In contrast, the
Llama2 model indicates an accuracy of 56\% with a mean absolute error of 7.63.
The ability to answer questions was also included in the system in order to
work with streamlined data. By evaluating the risks and opportunities presented
by LLMs, our work contributes to the ongoing dialogue on establishing
methodological validity and ethical guidelines for LLM use in HCI data work.

                                        <span>  Verifiable generation aims to let the large language model (LLM) generate
text with supporting documents, which enables the user to flexibly verify the
answer and makes the LLM's output more reliable. Retrieval plays a crucial role
in verifiable generation. Specifically, the retrieved documents not only
supplement knowledge to help the LLM generate correct answers, but also serve
as supporting evidence for the user to verify the LLM's output. However, the
widely used retrievers become the bottleneck of the entire pipeline and limit
the overall performance. Their capabilities are usually inferior to LLMs since
they often have much fewer parameters than the large language model and have
not been demonstrated to scale well to the size of LLMs. If the retriever does
not correctly find the supporting documents, the LLM can not generate the
correct and verifiable answer, which overshadows the LLM's remarkable
abilities. To address these limitations, we propose \LLatrieval (Large Language
Model Verified Retrieval), where the LLM updates the retrieval result until it
verifies that the retrieved documents can sufficiently support answering the
question. Thus, the LLM can iteratively provide feedback to retrieval and
facilitate the retrieval result to fully support verifiable generation.
Experiments show that LLatrieval significantly outperforms extensive baselines
and achieves state-of-the-art results.

consumer-to-consumer (C2C) e-commerce platforms usually encounter the
limited-stock problem, that is, a product can only be sold one time in a C2C
system. This poses several unique challenges for click-through rate (CTR)
prediction. Due to limited user interactions for each product (i.e. item), the
corresponding item embedding in the CTR model may not easily converge. This
makes the conventional sequence modeling based approaches cannot effectively
utilize user history information since historical user behaviors contain a
mixture of items with different volume of stocks. Particularly, the attention
mechanism in a sequence model tends to assign higher score to products with
more accumulated user interactions, making limited-stock products being ignored
and contribute less to the final output. To this end, we propose the Meta-Split
Network (MSNet) to split user history sequence regarding to the volume of stock
for each product, and adopt differentiated modeling approaches for different
sequences. As for the limited-stock products, a meta-learning approach is
applied to address the problem of inconvergence, which is achieved by designing
meta scaling and shifting networks with ID and side information. In addition,
traditional approach can hardly update item embedding once the product is
consumed. Thereby, we propose an auxiliary loss that makes the parameters
updatable even when the product is no longer in distribution. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first solution addressing the recommendation of
limited-stock product. Experimental results on the production dataset and
online A/B testing demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

of log data in near real-time. At query time the systems have to find relevant
logs based on the content of the log message using support structures that can
scale to these amounts of data while still being efficient to use. We present
our novel Compressed Probabilistic Retrieval algorithm (COPR), capable of
answering Multi-Set Multi-Membership-Queries, that can be used as an
alternative to existing indexing structures for streamed log data. In our
experiments, COPR required up to 93% less storage space than the tested
state-of-the-art inverted index and had up to four orders of magnitude less
false-positives than the tested state-of-the-art membership sketch.
Additionally, COPR achieved up to 250 times higher query throughput than the
tested inverted index and up to 240 times higher query throughput than the
tested membership sketch.

                                        <span>  The objective of search result diversification (SRD) is to ensure that
selected documents cover as many different subtopics as possible. Existing
methods primarily utilize a paradigm of "greedy selection", i.e., selecting one
document with the highest diversity score at a time. These approaches tend to
be inefficient and are easily trapped in a suboptimal state. In addition, some
other methods aim to approximately optimize the diversity metric, such as
$\alpha$-NDCG, but the results still remain suboptimal. To address these
challenges, we introduce Multi-Agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for search
result DIVersity, which called MA4DIV. In this approach, each document is an
agent and the search result diversification is modeled as a cooperative task
among multiple agents. This approach allows for directly optimizing the
diversity metrics, such as $\alpha$-NDCG, while achieving high training
efficiency. We conducted preliminary experiments on public TREC datasets to
demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of MA4DIV. Considering the limited
number of queries in public TREC datasets, we construct a large-scale dataset
from industry sources and show that MA4DIV achieves substantial improvements in
both effectiveness and efficiency than existing baselines on a industrial scale
dataset.

models (PLM-based IR) requires learning query representations and
query-document relations, in addition to downstream task-specific learning.
This study introduces coarse-tuning as an intermediate learning stage that
bridges pre-training and fine-tuning. By learning query representations and
query-document relations in coarse-tuning, we aim to reduce the load of
fine-tuning and improve the learning effect of downstream IR tasks. We propose
Query-Document Pair Prediction (QDPP) for coarse-tuning, which predicts the
appropriateness of query-document pairs. Evaluation experiments show that the
proposed method significantly improves MRR and/or nDCG@5 in four ad-hoc
document retrieval datasets. Furthermore, the results of the query prediction
task suggested that coarse-tuning facilitated learning of query representation
and query-document relations.

                                        <span>  In the absence of parallax cues, a learning-based single image depth
estimation (SIDE) model relies heavily on shading and contextual cues in the
image. While this simplicity is attractive, it is necessary to train such
models on large and varied datasets, which are difficult to capture. It has
been shown that using embeddings from pre-trained foundational models, such as
CLIP, improves zero shot transfer in several applications. Taking inspiration
from this, in our paper we explore the use of global image priors generated
from a pre-trained ViT model to provide more detailed contextual information.
We argue that the embedding vector from a ViT model, pre-trained on a large
dataset, captures greater relevant information for SIDE than the usual route of
generating pseudo image captions, followed by CLIP based text embeddings. Based
on this idea, we propose a new SIDE model using a diffusion backbone which is
conditioned on ViT embeddings. Our proposed design establishes a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) for SIDE on NYUv2 dataset, achieving Abs Rel error of
0.059(14% improvement) compared to 0.069 by the current SOTA (VPD). And on
KITTI dataset, achieving Sq Rel error of 0.139 (2% improvement) compared to
0.142 by the current SOTA (GEDepth). For zero-shot transfer with a model
trained on NYUv2, we report mean relative improvement of (20%, 23%, 81%, 25%)
over NeWCRFs on (Sun-RGBD, iBims1, DIODE, HyperSim) datasets, compared to (16%,
18%, 45%, 9%) by ZoeDepth. The code is available at

                                        <span>  Large language models (LLMs) often generate content that contains factual
errors when responding to fact-seeking prompts on open-ended topics. To
benchmark a model's long-form factuality in open domains, we first use GPT-4 to
generate LongFact, a prompt set comprising thousands of questions spanning 38
topics. We then propose that LLM agents can be used as automated evaluators for
long-form factuality through a method which we call Search-Augmented Factuality
Evaluator (SAFE). SAFE utilizes an LLM to break down a long-form response into
a set of individual facts and to evaluate the accuracy of each fact using a
multi-step reasoning process comprising sending search queries to Google Search
and determining whether a fact is supported by the search results. Furthermore,
we propose extending F1 score as an aggregated metric for long-form factuality.
To do so, we balance the percentage of supported facts in a response
(precision) with the percentage of provided facts relative to a hyperparameter
representing a user's preferred response length (recall).
  Empirically, we demonstrate that LLM agents can achieve superhuman rating
performance - on a set of ~16k individual facts, SAFE agrees with crowdsourced
human annotators 72% of the time, and on a random subset of 100 disagreement
cases, SAFE wins 76% of the time. At the same time, SAFE is more than 20 times
cheaper than human annotators. We also benchmark thirteen language models on
LongFact across four model families (Gemini, GPT, Claude, and PaLM-2), finding
that larger language models generally achieve better long-form factuality.
LongFact, SAFE, and all experimental code are available at

images such as ImageNet-C, ImageNet-9, and Stylized ImageNet provide specific
type of evaluation over synthetic corruptions, backgrounds, and textures, yet
those robustness benchmarks are restricted in specified variations and have low
synthetic quality. In this work, we introduce generative model as a data source
for synthesizing hard images that benchmark deep models' robustness. Leveraging
diffusion models, we are able to generate images with more diversified
backgrounds, textures, and materials than any prior work, where we term this
benchmark as ImageNet-D. Experimental results show that ImageNet-D results in a
significant accuracy drop to a range of vision models, from the standard ResNet
visual classifier to the latest foundation models like CLIP and MiniGPT-4,
significantly reducing their accuracy by up to 60\%. Our work suggests that
diffusion models can be an effective source to test vision models. The code and

                                        <span>  This paper introduces a novel K-means clustering algorithm, an advancement on
the conventional Big-means methodology. The proposed method efficiently
integrates parallel processing, stochastic sampling, and competitive
optimization to create a scalable variant designed for big data applications.
It addresses scalability and computation time challenges typically faced with
traditional techniques. The algorithm adjusts sample sizes dynamically for each
worker during execution, optimizing performance. Data from these sample sizes
are continually analyzed, facilitating the identification of the most efficient
configuration. By incorporating a competitive element among workers using
different sample sizes, efficiency within the Big-means algorithm is further
stimulated. In essence, the algorithm balances computational time and
clustering quality by employing a stochastic, competitive sampling strategy in
a parallel computing setting.

                                        <span>  Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated impressive results in
solving complex robotic tasks such as quadruped locomotion. Yet, current
solvers fail to produce efficient policies respecting hard constraints. In this
work, we advocate for integrating constraints into robot learning and present
Constraints as Terminations (CaT), a novel constrained RL algorithm. Departing
from classical constrained RL formulations, we reformulate constraints through
stochastic terminations during policy learning: any violation of a constraint
triggers a probability of terminating potential future rewards the RL agent
could attain. We propose an algorithmic approach to this formulation, by
minimally modifying widely used off-the-shelf RL algorithms in robot learning
(such as Proximal Policy Optimization). Our approach leads to excellent
constraint adherence without introducing undue complexity and computational
overhead, thus mitigating barriers to broader adoption. Through empirical
evaluation on the real quadruped robot Solo crossing challenging obstacles, we
demonstrate that CaT provides a compelling solution for incorporating
constraints into RL frameworks. Videos and code are available at

atherosclerosis on a plain frontal chest x-ray. Methods and Results. A
deep-learning algorithm to predict coronary artery calcium (CAC) score (the
AI-CAC model) was developed on 460 chest x-ray (80% training cohort, 20%
internal validation cohort) of primary prevention patients (58.4% male, median
age 63 [51-74] years) with available paired chest x-ray and chest computed
tomography (CT) indicated for any clinical reason and performed within 3
months. The CAC score calculated on chest CT was used as ground truth. The
model was validated on an temporally-independent cohort of 90 patients from the
same institution (external validation). The diagnostic accuracy of the AI-CAC
model assessed by the area under the curve (AUC) was the primary outcome.
Overall, median AI-CAC score was 35 (0-388) and 28.9% patients had no AI-CAC.
AUC of the AI-CAC model to identify a CAC>0 was 0.90 in the internal validation
cohort and 0.77 in the external validation cohort. Sensitivity was consistently
above 92% in both cohorts. In the overall cohort (n=540), among patients with
AI-CAC=0, a single ASCVD event occurred, after 4.3 years. Patients with
AI-CAC>0 had significantly higher Kaplan Meier estimates for ASCVD events
(13.5% vs. 3.4%, log-rank=0.013). Conclusion. The AI-CAC model seems to
accurately detect subclinical atherosclerosis on chest x-ray with elevated
sensitivity, and to predict ASCVD events with elevated negative predictive
value. Adoption of the AI-CAC model to refine CV risk stratification or as an
opportunistic screening tool requires prospective evaluation.

critical task for safely deploying models in real-world systems. While existing
alignment approaches have seen empirical success, theoretically understanding
how these methods affect model behavior remains an open question. Our work
provides an initial attempt to theoretically analyze the learning dynamics of
human preference alignment. We formally show how the distribution of preference
datasets influences the rate of model updates and provide rigorous guarantees
on the training accuracy. Our theory also reveals an intricate phenomenon where
the optimization is prone to prioritizing certain behaviors with higher
preference distinguishability. We empirically validate our findings on
contemporary LLMs and alignment tasks, reinforcing our theoretical insights and
shedding light on considerations for future alignment approaches. Disclaimer:

                                        <span>  Accurate predictions of when a component will fail are crucial when planning
maintenance, and by modeling the distribution of these failure times, survival
models have shown to be particularly useful in this context. The presented
methodology is based on conventional neural network-based survival models that
are trained using data that is continuously gathered and stored at specific
times, called snapshots. An important property of this type of training data is
that it can contain more than one snapshot from a specific individual which
results in that standard maximum likelihood training can not be directly
applied since the data is not independent. However, the papers show that if the
data is in a specific format where all snapshot times are the same for all
individuals, called homogeneously sampled, maximum likelihood training can be
applied and produce desirable results. In many cases, the data is not
homogeneously sampled and in this case, it is proposed to resample the data to
make it homogeneously sampled. How densely the dataset is sampled turns out to
be an important parameter; it should be chosen large enough to produce good
results, but this also increases the size of the dataset which makes training
slow. To reduce the number of samples needed during training, the paper also
proposes a technique to, instead of resampling the dataset once before the
training starts, randomly resample the dataset at the start of each epoch
during the training. The proposed methodology is evaluated on both a simulated
dataset and an experimental dataset of starter battery failures. The results
show that if the data is homogeneously sampled the methodology works as
intended and produces accurate survival models. The results also show that
randomly resampling the dataset on each epoch is an effective way to reduce the
size of the training data.

infinite-dimensional function spaces. Deep operator networks (DeepONets) are a
notable architecture in this field. Recently, an extension of DeepONet based on
model reduction and neural networks, proper orthogonal decomposition
(POD)-DeepONet, has been able to outperform other architectures in terms of
accuracy for several benchmark tests. We extend this idea towards nonlinear
model order reduction by proposing an efficient framework that combines neural

Our results demonstrate the superior performance of KPCA-DeepONet over
POD-DeepONet.

amplify the performance of machine learning (ML) models in forecasting the
quality of milling processes, as demonstrated in this paper through a
manufacturing use case. The methodology entails the initial training of ML
models, followed by a fine-tuning phase where irrelevant features identified
through explainability methods are eliminated. This procedural refinement
results in performance enhancements, paving the way for potential reductions in
manufacturing costs and a better understanding of the trained ML models. This
study highlights the usefulness of explainability techniques in both explaining
and optimizing predictive models in the manufacturing realm.

if $y$ had been $z$?" is fundamental for advancing medical image analysis.
Training causal generative models that address such counterfactual questions,
though, currently requires that all relevant variables have been observed and
that corresponding labels are available in training data. However, clinical
data may not have complete records for all patients and state of the art causal
generative models are unable to take full advantage of this. We thus develop,
for the first time, a semi-supervised deep causal generative model that
exploits the causal relationships between variables to maximise the use of all
available data. We explore this in the setting where each sample is either
fully labelled or fully unlabelled, as well as the more clinically realistic
case of having different labels missing for each sample. We leverage techniques
from causal inference to infer missing values and subsequently generate
realistic counterfactuals, even for samples with incomplete labels.

                                        <span>  Recent works have attempted to use deep learning to predict future states of
traffic flow, but have met with mixed results. These approaches face two key
challenges. First, training deep learning neural networks requires large
amounts of training data which are not yet easily available for traffic flow
systems. Second, even when data is available, the neural networks require
access to historical data that covers most possible traffic flow dynamics to
successfully predict future traffic states. Specifically, these deep learning
approaches do not fully leverage domain-knowledge about traffic flow dynamics,
despite a significant existing knowledge-base. In this work, we propose to
solve both issues using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) with Long Short
Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning architecture to successfully predict traffic
flow, while leveraging a cellular automata-based statistical mechanics model of
traffic flow to generate training and test data. Another major contribution of
this paper is the insight that training data for a large traffic system can
actually be sampled from the simulations of a much smaller traffic system. This
is achieved through observing that the normalized energy distribution of the
statistical mechanics model is scale invariant, which significantly eases the
burden of data generation for large scale traffic systems. The resulting
simulations indicate good agreement between the predicted and the true traffic
flow dynamics.

                                        <span>  In inverse problems, many conditional generative models approximate the
posterior measure by minimizing a distance between the joint measure and its
learned approximation. While this approach also controls the distance between
the posterior measures in the case of the Kullback--Leibler divergence, this is
in general not hold true for the Wasserstein distance. In this paper, we
introduce a conditional Wasserstein distance via a set of restricted couplings
that equals the expected Wasserstein distance of the posteriors. Interestingly,
the dual formulation of the conditional Wasserstein-1 flow resembles losses in
the conditional Wasserstein GAN literature in a quite natural way. We derive
theoretical properties of the conditional Wasserstein distance, characterize
the corresponding geodesics and velocity fields as well as the flow ODEs.
Subsequently, we propose to approximate the velocity fields by relaxing the
conditional Wasserstein distance. Based on this, we propose an extension of OT
Flow Matching for solving Bayesian inverse problems and demonstrate its
numerical advantages on an inverse problem and class-conditional image
generation.

                                        <span>  The advent of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has improved a variety of
fields by providing a versatile, cost-effective and accessible platform for
implementing state-of-the-art algorithms. To accomplish a broader range of
tasks, there is a growing need for enhanced on-board computing to cope with
increasing complexity and dynamic environmental conditions. Recent advances
have seen the application of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), particularly in
combination with Reinforcement Learning (RL), to improve the adaptability and
performance of UAVs, especially in unknown environments. However, the
computational requirements of DNNs pose a challenge to the limited computing
resources available on many UAVs. This work explores the use of Field
Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) as a viable solution to this challenge,
offering flexibility, high performance, energy and time efficiency. We propose
a novel hardware board equipped with an Artix-7 FPGA for a popular open-source
micro-UAV platform. We successfully validate its functionality by implementing
an RL-based low-level controller using real-world experiments.

contrastive learning, specifically examining the InfoNCE loss function and its
derivatives. We reveal a critical observation that these loss functions exhibit
a restrictive behavior, leading to a convergence phenomenon where embeddings
tend to merge into a singular point. This "over-fusion" effect detrimentally
affects classification accuracy in subsequent supervised-learning tasks.
Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that embeddings, when equalized or
confined to a rank-1 linear subspace, represent a local minimum for InfoNCE. In
response to this challenge, our research introduces an innovative strategy that
leverages the same or fewer labeled data than typically used in the fine-tuning
phase. The loss we proposed, Orthonormal Anchor Regression Loss, is designed to
disentangle embedding clusters, significantly enhancing the distinctiveness of
each embedding while simultaneously ensuring their aggregation into dense,
well-defined clusters. Our method demonstrates remarkable improvements with
just a fraction of the conventional label requirements, as evidenced by our
results on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets.

                                        <span>  In this work, we analyze the behavior of the multivariate symmetric
uncertainty (MSU) measure through the use of statistical simulation techniques
under various mixes of informative and non-informative randomly generated
features. Experiments show how the number of attributes, their cardinalities,
and the sample size affect the MSU. In this thesis, through observation of
results, it is proposed an heuristic condition that preserves good quality in
the MSU under different combinations of these three factors, providing a new
useful criterion to help drive the process of dimension reduction.

                                        <span>  This paper proposes a novel framework, TransFusion, designed to make the
process of contrastive learning more analytical and explainable. TransFusion
consists of attention blocks whose softmax being replaced by ReLU, and its
final block's weighted-sum operation is truncated to leave the adjacency matrix
as the output. The model is trained by minimizing the Jensen-Shannon Divergence
between its output and the target affinity matrix, which indicates whether each
pair of samples belongs to the same or different classes. The main contribution
of TransFusion lies in defining a theoretical limit for answering two
fundamental questions in the field: the maximum level of data augmentation and
the minimum batch size required for effective contrastive learning.
Furthermore, experimental results indicate that TransFusion successfully
extracts features that isolate clusters from complex real-world data, leading
to improved classification accuracy in downstream tasks.

constitutes one of major challenges in the AI field. In our work, we explore
paradigm introduced by Inference-Time-Intervention (ITI). In first stage, it
identifies attention heads, which contain the highest amount of desired type of
knowledge (e.g., truthful). Afterwards, during inference, LLM activations are
shifted for chosen subset of attention heads. We further improved the ITI
framework by introducing a nonlinear probing and multi-token intervention -
Non-Linear ITI (NL-ITI). NL-ITI is tested on diverse multiple-choice
benchmarks, including TruthfulQA, on which we report around 14% MC1 metric
improvement with respect to the baseline ITI results. NL-ITI achieves also
encouraging results on other testsets - on Business Ethics subdomain of MMLU,
around 18% MC1 improvement over baseline LLaMA2-7B. Additionally, NL-ITI
performs better while being less invasive in the behavior of LLM at the same
time (as measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence).

                                        <span>  Evaluating the veracity of everyday claims is time consuming and in some
cases requires domain expertise. We empirically demonstrate that the commonly
used fact checking pipeline, known as the retriever-reader, suffers from
performance deterioration when it is trained on the labeled data from one
domain and used in another domain. Afterwards, we delve into each component of
the pipeline and propose novel algorithms to address this problem. We propose
an adversarial algorithm to make the retriever component robust against
distribution shift. Our core idea is to initially train a bi-encoder on the
labeled source data, and then, to adversarially train two separate document and
claim encoders using unlabeled target data. We then focus on the reader
component and propose to train it such that it is insensitive towards the order
of claims and evidence documents. Our empirical evaluations support the
hypothesis that such a reader shows a higher robustness against distribution
shift. To our knowledge, there is no publicly available multi-topic fact
checking dataset. Thus, we propose a simple automatic method to re-purpose two
well-known fact checking datasets. We then construct eight fact checking
scenarios from these datasets, and compare our model to a set of strong
baseline models, including recent domain adaptation models that use GPT4 for
generating synthetic data.

track the patient's state and to identify clinically significant changes.
Predicting vital sign trajectories is valuable for early detection of adverse
events. However, conventional machine learning metrics like RMSE often fail to
capture the true clinical relevance of such predictions. We introduce novel
vital sign prediction performance metrics that align with clinical contexts,
focusing on deviations from clinical norms, overall trends, and trend
deviations. These metrics are derived from empirical utility curves obtained in
a previous study through interviews with ICU clinicians. We validate the
metrics' usefulness using simulated and real clinical datasets (MIMIC and
eICU). Furthermore, we employ these metrics as loss functions for neural
networks, resulting in models that excel in predicting clinically significant
events. This research paves the way for clinically relevant machine learning
model evaluation and optimization, promising to improve ICU patient care. 10

The models are specified based on piecewise definitions of the hazard function
and the density function on a partitioning of the time; both constant and
linear piecewise definitions are presented, resulting in a family of four
models. The models can be seen as an extension of the commonly used
discrete-time and piecewise exponential models and thereby add flexibility to
this set of standard models. Using a simulated dataset the models are shown to
perform well compared to the highly expressive, state-of-the-art energy-based
model, while only requiring a fraction of the computation time.

speech using acoustic and text-based features. We propose to obtain
contextualized word embeddings with BERT to represent the information contained
in speech transcriptions and show that this results in better performance than
using Glove embeddings. We also propose and compare different strategies to
combine the audio and text modalities, evaluating them on IEMOCAP and
MSP-PODCAST datasets. We find that fusing acoustic and text-based systems is
beneficial on both datasets, though only subtle differences are observed across
the evaluated fusion approaches. Finally, for IEMOCAP, we show the large effect
that the criteria used to define the cross-validation folds have on results. In
particular, the standard way of creating folds for this dataset results in a
highly optimistic estimation of performance for the text-based system,
suggesting that some previous works may overestimate the advantage of
incorporating transcriptions.

                                        <span>  Detecting Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and Prediabetes (PD) is a real challenge for
medicine due to the absence of pathogenic symptoms and the lack of known
associated risk factors. Even though some proposals for machine learning models
enable the identification of people at risk, the nature of the condition makes
it so that a model suitable for one population may not necessarily be suitable
for another. In this article, the development and assessment of predictive
models to identify people at risk for T2D and PD specifically in Argentina are
discussed. First, the database was thoroughly preprocessed and three specific
datasets were generated considering a compromise between the number of records
and the amount of available variables. After applying 5 different
classification models, the results obtained show that a very good performance
was observed for two datasets with some of these models. In particular, RF, DT,
and ANN demonstrated great classification power, with good values for the
metrics under consideration. Given the lack of this type of tool in Argentina,
this work represents the first step towards the development of more
sophisticated models.

interest as it is useful for informing on generalisability and adversarial
robustness. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in particular, underpin much
of the recent success in computer vision related applications. However,
although existing methods for estimating the Lipschitz constant can be tight,
they have limited scalability when applied to CNNs. To tackle this, we propose
a novel method to accelerate Lipschitz constant estimation for CNNs. The core
idea is to divide a large convolutional block via a joint layer and width-wise
partition, into a collection of smaller blocks. We prove an upper-bound on the
Lipschitz constant of the larger block in terms of the Lipschitz constants of
the smaller blocks. Through varying the partition factor, the resulting method
can be adjusted to prioritise either accuracy or scalability and permits
parallelisation. We demonstrate an enhanced scalability and comparable accuracy
to existing baselines through a range of experiments.

                                        <span>  Human tissues are highly organized structures with specific collagen fiber
arrangements varying from point to point. The effects of such heterogeneity
play an important role for tissue function, and hence it is of critical to
discover and understand the distribution of such fiber orientations from
experimental measurements, such as the digital image correlation data. To this
end, we introduce the heterogeneous peridynamic neural operator (HeteroPNO)
approach, for data-driven constitutive modeling of heterogeneous anisotropic
materials. The goal is to learn both a nonlocal constitutive law together with
the material microstructure, in the form of a heterogeneous fiber orientation
field, from loading field-displacement field measurements. To this end, we
propose a two-phase learning approach. Firstly, we learn a homogeneous
constitutive law in the form of a neural network-based kernel function and a
nonlocal bond force, to capture complex homogeneous material responses from
data. Then, in the second phase we reinitialize the learnt bond force and the
kernel function, and training them together with a fiber orientation field for
each material point. Owing to the state-based peridynamic skeleton, our
HeteroPNO-learned material models are objective and have the balance of linear
and angular momentum guaranteed. Moreover, the effects from heterogeneity and
nonlinear constitutive relationship are captured by the kernel function and the
bond force respectively, enabling physical interpretability. As a result, our
HeteroPNO architecture can learn a constitutive model for a biological tissue
with anisotropic heterogeneous response undergoing large deformation regime.
Moreover, the framework is capable to provide displacement and stress field
predictions for new and unseen loading instances.

                                        <span>  Resource efficiency plays an important role for machine learning nowadays.
The energy and decision latency are two critical aspects to ensure a
sustainable and practical application. Unfortunately, the energy consumption
and decision latency are not robust against adversaries. Researchers have
recently demonstrated that attackers can compute and submit so-called sponge
examples at inference time to increase the energy consumption and decision
latency of neural networks. In computer vision, the proposed strategy crafts
inputs with less activation sparsity which could otherwise be used to
accelerate the computation. In this paper, we analyze the mechanism how these
energy-latency attacks reduce activation sparsity. In particular, we find that
input uniformity is a key enabler. A uniform image, that is, an image with
mostly flat, uniformly colored surfaces, triggers more activations due to a
specific interplay of convolution, batch normalization, and ReLU activation.
Based on these insights, we propose two new simple, yet effective strategies
for crafting sponge examples: sampling images from a probability distribution
and identifying dense, yet inconspicuous inputs in natural datasets. We
empirically examine our findings in a comprehensive evaluation with multiple
image classification models and show that our attack achieves the same sparsity
effect as prior sponge-example methods, but at a fraction of computation
effort. We also show that our sponge examples transfer between different neural
networks. Finally, we discuss applications of our findings for the good by
improving efficiency by increasing sparsity.

(data) using a simple architecture based on a single normalising flow with a
boolean condition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on a
physics-inspired toy dataset with non-trivial mismodelling of several
observables and their correlations.

with an immense amount of data and computational power required for training.
Therefore, training is usually outsourced into HPC facilities, where we have
started to experience limits in scaling conventional HPC hardware, as theorized
by Moore's law. Despite heavy parallelization and optimization efforts, current
state-of-the-art ML models require weeks for training, which is associated with
an enormous $CO_2$ footprint. Quantum Computing, and specifically Quantum
Machine Learning (QML), can offer significant theoretical speed-ups and
enhanced expressive power. However, training QML models requires tuning various
hyperparameters, which is a nontrivial task and suboptimal choices can highly
affect the trainability and performance of the models. In this study, we
identify the most impactful hyperparameters and collect data about the
performance of QML models. We compare different configurations and provide
researchers with performance data and concrete suggestions for hyperparameter
selection.

sample diversity can be challenging, especially when the number of graph
observations is small. Here, we tackle the problem of graph generation from
only one observed graph. The classical approach of graph generation from
parametric models relies on the estimation of parameters, which can be
inconsistent or expensive to compute due to intractable normalisation
constants. Generative modelling based on machine learning techniques to
generate high-quality graph samples avoids parameter estimation but usually
requires abundant training samples. Our proposed generating procedure,
SteinGen, which is phrased in the setting of graphs as realisations of
exponential random graph models, combines ideas from Stein's method and MCMC by
employing Markovian dynamics which are based on a Stein operator for the target
model. SteinGen uses the Glauber dynamics associated with an estimated Stein
operator to generate a sample, and re-estimates the Stein operator from the
sample after every sampling step. We show that on a class of exponential random
graph models this novel "estimation and re-estimation" generation strategy
yields high distributional similarity (high fidelity) to the original data,
combined with high sample diversity.

infrastructure which is pivotal to urban development. As 70% of the world's
population will likely live in urban environments in 2050, efficient simulation
and planning tools for WDS play a crucial role in reaching UN's sustainable
developmental goal (SDG) 6 - "Clean water and sanitation for all". In this
realm, we propose a novel and efficient machine learning emulator, more
precisely, a physics-informed deep learning (DL) model, for hydraulic state
estimation in WDS. Using a recursive approach, our model only needs a few graph
convolutional neural network (GCN) layers and employs an innovative algorithm
based on message passing. Unlike conventional machine learning tasks, the model
uses hydraulic principles to infer two additional hydraulic state features in
the process of reconstructing the available ground truth feature in an
unsupervised manner. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first DL
approach to emulate the popular hydraulic simulator EPANET, utilizing no
additional information. Like most DL models and unlike the hydraulic simulator,
our model demonstrates vastly faster emulation times that do not increase
drastically with the size of the WDS. Moreover, we achieve high accuracy on the
ground truth and very similar results compared to the hydraulic simulator as
demonstrated through experiments on five real-world WDS datasets.

configuration and cell current consumption. As the integrated circuit (IC)
design is growing larger, dynamic IR drop simulation becomes computationally
unaffordable and machine learning based IR drop prediction has been explored as
a promising solution. Although CNN-based methods have been adapted to IR drop
prediction task in several works, the shortcomings of overlooking PDN
configuration is non-negligible. In this paper, we consider not only how to
properly represent cell-PDN relation, but also how to model IR drop following
its physical nature in the feature aggregation procedure. Thus, we propose a
novel graph structure, PDNGraph, to unify the representations of the PDN
structure and the fine-grained cell-PDN relation. We further propose a
dual-branch heterogeneous network, PDNNet, incorporating two parallel GNN-CNN
branches to favorably capture the above features during the learning process.
Several key designs are presented to make the dynamic IR drop prediction highly
effective and interpretable. We are the first work to apply graph structure to
deep-learning based dynamic IR drop prediction method. Experiments show that
PDNNet outperforms the state-of-the-art CNN-based methods by up to 39.3%
reduction in prediction error and achieves 545x speedup compared to the
commercial tool, which demonstrates the superiority of our method.

spotting (KWS) algorithm is used. Modern KWS systems are mainly trained using
supervised learning methods and require a large amount of labelled data to
achieve a good performance. Leveraging unlabelled data through self-supervised
learning (SSL) has been shown to increase the accuracy in clean conditions.
This paper explores how SSL pretraining such as Data2Vec can be used to enhance
the robustness of KWS models in noisy conditions, which is under-explored.
  Models of three different sizes are pretrained using different pretraining
approaches and then fine-tuned for KWS. These models are then tested and
compared to models trained using two baseline supervised learning methods, one
being standard training using clean data and the other one being multi-style
training (MTR). The results show that pretraining and fine-tuning on clean data
is superior to supervised learning on clean data across all testing conditions,
and superior to supervised MTR for testing conditions of SNR above 5 dB. This
indicates that pretraining alone can increase the model's robustness. Finally,
it is found that using noisy data for pretraining models, especially with the
Data2Vec-denoising approach, significantly enhances the robustness of KWS
models in noisy conditions.

been proposed to predict how humans comprehend and process sentence. One
particularly promising approach is contextual semantic similarity. Inspired by
the attention algorithm in Transformer and human memory mechanisms, this study
proposes an ``attention-aware'' approach for computing contextual semantic
relevance. This new approach takes into account the different contributions of
contextual parts and the expectation effect, allowing it to incorporate
contextual information fully. The attention-aware approach also facilitates the
simulation of existing reading models and evaluate them. The resulting
``attention-aware'' metrics of semantic relevance can more accurately predict
fixation durations in Chinese reading tasks recorded in an eye-tracking corpus
than those calculated by existing approaches. The study's findings further
provide strong support for the presence of semantic preview benefits in Chinese
naturalistic reading. Furthermore, the attention-aware metrics of semantic
relevance, being memory-based, possess high interpretability from both
linguistic and cognitive standpoints, making them a valuable computational tool
for modeling eye-movements in reading and further gaining insight into the
process of language comprehension. Our approach underscores the potential of
these metrics to advance our comprehension of how humans understand and process
language, ultimately leading to a better understanding of language
comprehension and processing.

                                        <span>  Applying iterative solvers on sparsity-constrained optimization (SCO)
requires tedious mathematical deduction and careful programming/debugging that
hinders these solvers' broad impact. In the paper, the library skscope is
introduced to overcome such an obstacle. With skscope, users can solve the SCO
by just programming the objective function. The convenience of skscope is
demonstrated through two examples in the paper, where sparse linear regression
and trend filtering are addressed with just four lines of code. More
importantly, skscope's efficient implementation allows state-of-the-art solvers
to quickly attain the sparse solution regardless of the high dimensionality of
parameter space. Numerical experiments reveal the available solvers in skscope
can achieve up to 80x speedup on the competing relaxation solutions obtained
via the benchmarked convex solver. skscope is published on the Python Package
Index (PyPI) and Conda, and its source code is available at:

                                        <span>  Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in solving
relatively complex tasks, yet the deployment of RL systems in real-world
scenarios poses significant challenges related to safety and robustness. This
paper aims to identify and further understand those challenges thorough the
exploration of the main dimensions of the safe and robust RL landscape,
encompassing algorithmic, ethical, and practical considerations. We conduct a
comprehensive review of methodologies and open problems that summarizes the
efforts in recent years to address the inherent risks associated with RL
applications.
  After discussing and proposing definitions for both safe and robust RL, the
paper categorizes existing research works into different algorithmic approaches
that enhance the safety and robustness of RL agents. We examine techniques such
as uncertainty estimation, optimisation methodologies, exploration-exploitation
trade-offs, and adversarial training. Environmental factors, including
sim-to-real transfer and domain adaptation, are also scrutinized to understand
how RL systems can adapt to diverse and dynamic surroundings. Moreover, human
involvement is an integral ingredient of the analysis, acknowledging the broad
set of roles that humans can take in this context.
  Importantly, to aid practitioners in navigating the complexities of safe and
robust RL implementation, this paper introduces a practical checklist derived
from the synthesized literature. The checklist encompasses critical aspects of
algorithm design, training environment considerations, and ethical guidelines.
It will serve as a resource for developers and policymakers alike to ensure the
responsible deployment of RL systems in many application domains.

autoencoders (VAEs) and rate-distortion theory, notably in utilizing VAEs to
estimate the theoretical upper bound of the information rate-distortion
function of images. Such estimated theoretical bounds substantially exceed the
performance of existing neural image codecs (NICs). To narrow this gap, we
propose a theoretical bound-guided hierarchical VAE (BG-VAE) for NIC. The
proposed BG-VAE leverages the theoretical bound to guide the NIC model towards
enhanced performance. We implement the BG-VAE using Hierarchical VAEs and
demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments. Along with
advanced neural network blocks, we provide a versatile, variable-rate NIC that
outperforms existing methods when considering both rate-distortion performance
and computational complexity. The code is available at BG-VAE.

Out-of-Distribution (OoD) generalization under various types of distribution
shifts. Recent studies attempted to investigate the leading cause of this
capability. In this work, we follow the same path, but focus on a specific type
of OoD data - images with novel compositions of attribute-object pairs - and
study whether such models can successfully classify those images into
composition classes. We carefully designed an authentic image test dataset
called ImageNet-AO, consisting of attributes for objects that are unlikely
encountered in the CLIP training sets. We found that CLIPs trained with large
datasets such as OpenAI CLIP, LAION-400M, and LAION-2B show orders-of-magnitude
improvement in effective compositional OoD generalization compared to both
supervised models and CLIPs trained with smaller datasets, such as CC-12M and
YFCC-15M. Our results provide evidence that the scale and diversity of training
data and language supervision play a key role in unlocking the compositional
generalization abilities of vision-language models.

the performance of traditional stochastic gradient descent techniques,
eliminating the need for a specific learning rate schedule. In this paper, we
identify existing issues in state-of-the-art line search methods, propose
enhancements, and rigorously evaluate their effectiveness. We test these
methods on larger datasets and more complex data domains than before.
Specifically, we improve the Armijo line search by integrating the momentum
term from ADAM in its search direction, enabling efficient large-scale
training, a task that was previously prone to failure using Armijo line search
methods. Our optimization approach outperforms both the previous Armijo
implementation and tuned learning rate schedules for Adam. Our evaluation
focuses on Transformers and CNNs in the domains of NLP and image data. Our work
is publicly available as a Python package, which provides a hyperparameter free
Pytorch optimizer.

Matrix Factorization or sparse Nonnegative Tucker Decomposition are an
important branch of dimensionality reduction models with enhanced
interpretability. However, from a practical perspective, the choice of
regularizers and regularization coefficients, as well as the design of
efficient algorithms, is challenging because of the multifactor nature of these
models and the lack of theory to back these choices. This paper aims at
improving upon these issues. By studying a more general model called the
Homogeneous Regularized Scale-Invariant, we prove that the scale-invariance
inherent to low-rank approximation models causes an implicit regularization
with both unexpected beneficial and detrimental effects. This observation
allows to better understand the effect of regularization functions in low-rank
approximation models, to guide the choice of the regularization
hyperparameters, and to design balancing strategies to enhance the convergence
speed of dedicated optimization algorithms. Some of these results were already
known but restricted to specific instances of regularized low-rank
approximations. We also derive a generic Majorization Minimization algorithm
that handles many regularized nonnegative low-rank approximations, with
convergence guarantees. We showcase our contributions on sparse Nonnegative
Matrix Factorization, ridge-regularized Canonical Polyadic decomposition and
sparse Nonnegative Tucker Decomposition.

healthy data only and measuring the deviation from the training set upon
inference, for example with CNN-based feature extraction and one-class
classifiers, or reconstruction-score-based methods such as AEs, GANs and
Diffusion models. Normalizing Flows (NF) have the ability to directly learn the
probability distribution of training examples through an invertible
architecture. We leverage this property in a novel 3D NF-based model named
CT-3DFlow, specifically tailored for patient-level pulmonary pathology
detection in chest CT data. Our model is trained unsupervised on healthy 3D
pulmonary CT patches, and detects deviations from its log-likelihood
distribution as anomalies. We aggregate patches-level likelihood values from a
patient's CT scan to provide a patient-level 'normal'/'abnormal' prediction.
Out-of-distribution detection performance is evaluated using expert annotations
on a separate chest CT test dataset, outperforming other state-of-the-art

                                        <span>  We introduce a distributed algorithm, termed noise-robust distributed maximum
consensus (RD-MC), for estimating the maximum value within a multi-agent
network in the presence of noisy communication links. Our approach entails
redefining the maximum consensus problem as a distributed optimization problem,
allowing a solution using the alternating direction method of multipliers.
Unlike existing algorithms that rely on multiple sets of noise-corrupted
estimates, RD-MC employs a single set, enhancing both robustness and
efficiency. To further mitigate the effects of link noise and improve
robustness, we apply moving averaging to the local estimates. Through extensive
simulations, we demonstrate that RD-MC is significantly more robust to
communication link noise compared to existing maximum-consensus algorithms.

                                        <span>  Recent works have shown that line search methods greatly increase performance
of traditional stochastic gradient descent methods on a variety of datasets and
architectures [1], [2]. In this work we succeed in extending line search
methods to the novel and highly popular Transformer architecture and dataset
domains in natural language processing. More specifically, we combine the
Armijo line search with the Adam optimizer and extend it by subdividing the
networks architecture into sensible units and perform the line search
separately on these local units. Our optimization method outperforms the
traditional Adam optimizer and achieves significant performance improvements
for small data sets or small training budgets, while performing equal or better
for other tested cases. Our work is publicly available as a python package,
which provides a hyperparameter-free pytorch optimizer that is compatible with
arbitrary network architectures.

                                        <span>  Deep subsurface exploration is important for mining, oil and gas industries,
as well as in the assessment of geological units for the disposal of chemical
or nuclear waste, or the viability of geothermal energy systems. Typically,
detailed examinations of subsurface formations or units are performed on
cuttings or core materials extracted during drilling campaigns, as well as on
geophysical borehole data, which provide detailed information about the
petrophysical properties of the rocks. Depending on the volume of rock samples
and the analytical program, the laboratory analysis and diagnostics can be very
time-consuming. This study investigates the potential of utilizing machine
learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN), to assess the
lithology and mineral content solely from analysis of drill core images, aiming
to support and expedite the subsurface geological exploration. The paper
outlines a comprehensive methodology, encompassing data preprocessing, machine
learning methods, and transfer learning techniques. The outcome reveals a
remarkable 96.7% accuracy in the classification of drill core segments into
distinct formation classes. Furthermore, a CNN model was trained for the
evaluation of mineral content using a learning data set from multidimensional
log analysis data (silicate, total clay, carbonate). When benchmarked against
laboratory XRD measurements on samples from the cores, both the advanced
multidimensional log analysis model and the neural network approach developed
here provide equally good performance. This work demonstrates that deep
learning and particularly transfer learning can support extracting
petrophysical properties, including mineral content and formation
classification, from drill core images, thus offering a road map for enhancing
model performance and data set quality in image-based analysis of drill cores.

through the lens of gradient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), examining the
behavior of first-order optimizers like Adam in non-convex objectives. By
interpreting the drift/diffusion phases in the information bottleneck theory,
focusing on gradient homogeneity, we identify a third phase termed ``total
diffusion", characterized by equilibrium in the learning rates and homogeneous
gradients. This phase is marked by an abrupt SNR increase, uniform residuals
across the sample space and the most rapid training convergence. We propose a
residual-based re-weighting scheme to accelerate this diffusion in quadratic
loss functions, enhancing generalization. We also explore the information
compression phenomenon, pinpointing a significant saturation-induced
compression of activations at the total diffusion phase, with deeper layers
experiencing negligible information loss. Supported by experimental data on
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), which underscore the importance of
gradient homogeneity due to their PDE-based sample inter-dependence, our
findings suggest that recognizing phase transitions could refine ML
optimization strategies for improved generalization.

                                        <span>  Reference Evapotranspiration (ET0) is a key parameter for designing smart
irrigation scheduling, since it is related by a coefficient to the water needs
of a crop. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, proposed a
standard method for ET0 computation (FAO56PM), based on the parameterization of
the Penman-Monteith equation, that is widely adopted in the literature. To
compute ET0 using the FAO56-PM method, four main weather parameters are needed:
temperature, humidity, wind, and solar radiation (SR). One way to make daily
ET0 estimations for future days is to use freely available weather forecast
services (WFSs), where many meteorological parameters are estimated up to the
next 15 days. A problem with this method is that currently, SR is not provided
as a free forecast parameter on most of those online services or, normally,
such forecasts present a financial cost penalty. For this reason, several ET0
estimation models using machine and deep learning were developed and presented
in the literature, that use as input features a reduced set of carefully
selected weather parameters, that are compatible with common freely available
WFSs. However, most studies on this topic have only evaluated model performance
using data from weather stations (WSs), without considering the effect of using
weather forecast data. In this study, the performance of authors' previous
models is evaluated when using weather forecast data from two online WFSs, in
the following scenarios: (i) direct ET0 estimation by an ANN model, and (ii)
estimate SR by ANN model, and then use that estimation for ET0 computation,
using the FAO56-PM method. Employing data collected from two WFSs and a WS
located in Vale do Lobo, Portugal, the latter approach achieved the best
result, with a coefficient of determination (R2) ranging between 0.893 and
0.667, when considering forecasts up to 15 days.

the use of generative models, specifically diffusion models. While diffusion
models have previously been successfully applied to electroencephalogram (EEG)
data, existing models lack flexibility w.r.t.~sampling or require alternative
representations of the EEG data. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a
novel approach to conditional diffusion models that utilizes classifier-free
guidance to directly generate subject-, session-, and class-specific EEG data.
In addition to commonly used metrics, domain-specific metrics are employed to
evaluate the specificity of the generated samples. The results indicate that
the proposed model can generate EEG data that resembles real data for each
subject, session, and class.

                                        <span>  There are five types of trajectory prediction tasks: deterministic,
stochastic, domain adaptation, momentary observation, and few-shot. These
associated tasks are defined by various factors, such as the length of input
paths, data split and pre-processing methods. Interestingly, even though they
commonly take sequential coordinates of observations as input and infer future
paths in the same coordinates as output, designing specialized architectures
for each task is still necessary. For the other task, generality issues can
lead to sub-optimal performances. In this paper, we propose SingularTrajectory,
a diffusion-based universal trajectory prediction framework to reduce the
performance gap across the five tasks. The core of SingularTrajectory is to
unify a variety of human dynamics representations on the associated tasks. To
do this, we first build a Singular space to project all types of motion
patterns from each task into one embedding space. We next propose an adaptive
anchor working in the Singular space. Unlike traditional fixed anchor methods
that sometimes yield unacceptable paths, our adaptive anchor enables correct
anchors, which are put into a wrong location, based on a traversability map.
Finally, we adopt a diffusion-based predictor to further enhance the prototype
paths using a cascaded denoising process. Our unified framework ensures the
generality across various benchmark settings such as input modality, and
trajectory lengths. Extensive experiments on five public benchmarks demonstrate
that SingularTrajectory substantially outperforms existing models, highlighting
its effectiveness in estimating general dynamics of human movements. Code is

                                        <span>  Foundation models (FMs) emerge as a promising solution to harness distributed
and diverse environmental data by leveraging prior knowledge to understand the
complicated temporal and spatial correlations within heterogeneous datasets.
Unlike distributed learning frameworks such as federated learning, which often
struggle with multimodal data, FMs can transform diverse inputs into
embeddings. This process facilitates the integration of information from
various modalities and the application of prior learning to new domains.
However, deploying FMs in resource-constrained edge systems poses significant
challenges. To this end, we introduce CoRAST, a novel learning framework that
utilizes FMs for enhanced analysis of distributed, correlated heterogeneous
data. Utilizing a server-based FM, CoRAST can exploit existing environment
information to extract temporal, spatial, and cross-modal correlations among
sensor data. This enables CoRAST to offer context-aware insights for localized
client tasks through FM-powered global representation learning. Our evaluation
on real-world weather dataset demonstrates CoRAST's ability to exploit
correlated heterogeneous data through environmental representation learning to
reduce the forecast errors by up to 50.3% compared to the baselines.

                                        <span>  Language models have demonstrated impressive ability in context understanding
and generative performance. Inspired by the recent success of language
foundation models, in this paper, we propose LMTraj (Language-based Multimodal
Trajectory predictor), which recasts the trajectory prediction task into a sort
of question-answering problem. Departing from traditional numerical regression
models, which treat the trajectory coordinate sequence as continuous signals,
we consider them as discrete signals like text prompts. Specially, we first
transform an input space for the trajectory coordinate into the natural
language space. Here, the entire time-series trajectories of pedestrians are
converted into a text prompt, and scene images are described as text
information through image captioning. The transformed numerical and image data
are then wrapped into the question-answering template for use in a language
model. Next, to guide the language model in understanding and reasoning
high-level knowledge, such as scene context and social relationships between
pedestrians, we introduce an auxiliary multi-task question and answering. We
then train a numerical tokenizer with the prompt data. We encourage the
tokenizer to separate the integer and decimal parts well, and leverage it to
capture correlations between the consecutive numbers in the language model.
Lastly, we train the language model using the numerical tokenizer and all of
the question-answer prompts. Here, we propose a beam-search-based most-likely
prediction and a temperature-based multimodal prediction to implement both
deterministic and stochastic inferences. Applying our LMTraj, we show that the
language-based model can be a powerful pedestrian trajectory predictor, and
outperforms existing numerical-based predictor methods. Code is publicly

demonstrates a remarkable ability to train models on heterogeneous datasets
while maintaining data privacy, making it suitable for smart grid applications,
which often involve disparate data distributions and interdependencies among
features that hinder the suitability of linear models. This paper introduces a

latent interconnections and employs personalized encoding methods to capture
unique insights, understanding the relationships between features and optimal

Experimental results validate the robustness of our approach, affirming its
proficiency in effectively learning policy models for smart grid challenges.

interaction between vegetation activity and ecosystem processes. Previous
research has established that long-term trends and short-term variability of
temperature and precipitation affect vegetation activity. Motivated by the
recent success of Transformer-based Deep Learning models for medium-range
weather forecasting, we adapt the publicly available pre-trained FourCastNet to
model vegetation activity while accounting for the short-term dynamics of
climate variability. We investigate how the learned global representation of
the atmosphere's state can be transferred to model the normalized difference
vegetation index (NDVI). Our model globally estimates vegetation activity at a
resolution of \SI{0.25}{\degree} while relying only on meteorological data. We
demonstrate that leveraging pre-trained weather models improves the NDVI
estimates compared to learning an NDVI model from scratch. Additionally, we
compare our results to other recent data-driven NDVI modeling approaches from
machine learning and ecology literature. We further provide experimental
evidence on how much data and training time is necessary to turn FourCastNet
into an effective vegetation model. Code and models will be made available upon
publication.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we investigate collaborative active learning, a paradigm in
which multiple collaborators explore a new domain by leveraging their combined
machine learning capabilities without disclosing their existing data and
models. Instead, the collaborators share prediction results from the new domain
and newly acquired labels. This collaboration offers several advantages: (a) it
addresses privacy and security concerns by eliminating the need for direct
model and data disclosure; (b) it enables the use of different data sources and
insights without direct data exchange; and (c) it promotes cost-effectiveness
and resource efficiency through shared labeling costs. To realize these
benefits, we introduce a collaborative active learning framework designed to
fulfill the aforementioned objectives. We validate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework through simulations. The results demonstrate that
collaboration leads to higher AUC scores compared to independent efforts,
highlighting the framework's ability to overcome the limitations of individual
models. These findings support the use of collaborative approaches in active
learning, emphasizing their potential to enhance outcomes through collective
expertise and shared resources. Our work provides a foundation for further
research on collaborative active learning and its practical applications in
various domains where data privacy, cost efficiency, and model performance are
critical considerations.

                                        <span>  Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in text-to-image
synthesis, producing realistic and high resolution images that faithfully
adhere to the corresponding text-prompts. Despite their great success, they
still fall behind in sketch-to-image synthesis tasks, where in addition to
text-prompts, the spatial layout of the generated images has to closely follow
the outlines of certain reference sketches. Employing an MLP latent edge
predictor to guide the spatial layout of the synthesized image by predicting
edge maps at each denoising step has been recently proposed. Despite yielding
promising results, the pixel-wise operation of the MLP does not take into
account the spatial layout as a whole, and demands numerous denoising
iterations to produce satisfactory images, leading to time inefficiency. To
this end, we introduce U-Sketch, a framework featuring a U-Net type latent edge
predictor, which is capable of efficiently capturing both local and global
features, as well as spatial correlations between pixels. Moreover, we propose
the addition of a sketch simplification network that offers the user the choice
of preprocessing and simplifying input sketches for enhanced outputs. The
experimental results, corroborated by user feedback, demonstrate that our
proposed U-Net latent edge predictor leads to more realistic results, that are
better aligned with the spatial outlines of the reference sketches, while
drastically reducing the number of required denoising steps and, consequently,
the overall execution time.

                                        <span>  Language models (LMs) are indispensable tools for natural language processing
tasks, but their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains a concern. While
current research has explored adversarial training techniques, their
improvements to defend against word-level attacks have been limited. In this
work, we propose a novel approach called Semantic Robust Defence (SemRoDe), a
Macro Adversarial Training strategy to enhance the robustness of LMs. Drawing
inspiration from recent studies in the image domain, we investigate and later
confirm that in a discrete data setting such as language, adversarial samples
generated via word substitutions do indeed belong to an adversarial domain
exhibiting a high Wasserstein distance from the base domain. Our method learns
a robust representation that bridges these two domains. We hypothesize that if
samples were not projected into an adversarial domain, but instead to a domain
with minimal shift, it would improve attack robustness. We align the domains by
incorporating a new distance-based objective. With this, our model is able to
learn more generalized representations by aligning the model's high-level
output features and therefore better handling unseen adversarial samples. This
method can be generalized across word embeddings, even when they share minimal
overlap at both vocabulary and word-substitution levels. To evaluate the
effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments on BERT and RoBERTa
models on three datasets. The results demonstrate promising state-of-the-art
robustness.

network architectures as the engine behind large language models. We provide a
theoretical analysis of the expressivity of the transformer architecture
through the lens of topos theory. From this viewpoint, we show that many common
neural network architectures, such as the convolutional, recurrent and graph
convolutional networks, can be embedded in a pretopos of piecewise-linear
functions, but that the transformer necessarily lives in its topos completion.
In particular, this suggests that the two network families instantiate
different fragments of logic: the former are first order, whereas transformers
are higher-order reasoners. Furthermore, we draw parallels with architecture
search and gradient descent, integrating our analysis in the framework of
cybernetic agents.

                                        <span>  Stimulated by the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of recent Large
Language Models (LLMs), a variety of strategies for bridging video modality
have been devised. A prominent strategy involves Video Language Models
(VideoLMs), which train a learnable interface with video data to connect
advanced vision encoders with LLMs. Recently, an alternative strategy has
surfaced, employing readily available foundation models, such as VideoLMs and
LLMs, across multiple stages for modality bridging. In this study, we introduce
a simple yet novel strategy where only a single Vision Language Model (VLM) is
utilized. Our starting point is the plain insight that a video comprises a
series of images, or frames, interwoven with temporal information. The essence
of video comprehension lies in adeptly managing the temporal aspects along with
the spatial details of each frame. Initially, we transform a video into a
single composite image by arranging multiple frames in a grid layout. The
resulting single image is termed as an image grid. This format, while
maintaining the appearance of a solitary image, effectively retains temporal
information within the grid structure. Therefore, the image grid approach
enables direct application of a single high-performance VLM without
necessitating any video-data training. Our extensive experimental analysis
across ten zero-shot video question answering benchmarks, including five
open-ended and five multiple-choice benchmarks, reveals that the proposed Image
Grid Vision Language Model (IG-VLM) surpasses the existing methods in nine out
of ten benchmarks.

classification is developed, leveraging ENF. Spectrograms are generated from
audio and power recordings across different grids, revealing distinctive ENF
patterns that aid in grid classification through a fusion of classifiers. Four
traditional machine learning classifiers plus a Convolutional Neural Network

are then compiled and used to train a shallow multi-label neural network
specifically designed to model the fusion process, ultimately leading to the
conclusive class prediction for each sample. Experimental findings reveal that
both validation and testing accuracy outperform those of current
state-of-the-art classifiers, underlining the effectiveness and robustness of
the proposed methodology.

the ability to depict the emotions of an artist. Many researchers have made
attempts to study abstract art in the form of edge detection, brush stroke and
emotion recognition algorithms using machine and deep learning. This papers
describes the study of a wide distribution of abstract paintings using
Generative Adversarial Neural Networks(GAN). GANs have the ability to learn and
reproduce a distribution enabling researchers and scientists to effectively
explore and study the generated image space. However, the challenge lies in
developing an efficient GAN architecture that overcomes common training
pitfalls. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a modified-DCGAN
(mDCGAN) specifically designed for high-quality artwork generation. The
approach involves a thorough exploration of the modifications made, delving
into the intricate workings of DCGANs, optimisation techniques, and
regularisation methods aimed at improving stability and realism in art
generation enabling effective study of generated patterns. The proposed mDCGAN
incorporates meticulous adjustments in layer configurations and architectural
choices, offering tailored solutions to the unique demands of art generation
while effectively combating issues like mode collapse and gradient vanishing.
Further this paper explores the generated latent space by performing random
walks to understand vector relationships between brush strokes and colours in
the abstract art space and a statistical analysis of unstable outputs after a
certain period of GAN training and compare its significant difference. These
findings validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, emphasising its
potential to revolutionise the field of digital art generation and digital art
ecosystem.

                                        <span>  Graph learning is widely recognized as a crucial technique in multi-view
clustering. Existing graph learning methods typically involve constructing an
adaptive neighbor graph based on probabilistic neighbors and then learning a
consensus graph to for clustering, however, they are confronted with two
limitations. Firstly, they often rely on Euclidean distance to measure
similarity when constructing the adaptive neighbor graph, which proves
inadequate in capturing the intrinsic structure among data points in many
real-world scenarios. Secondly, most of these methods focus solely on consensus
graph, ignoring view-specific graph information. In response to the
aforementioned drawbacks, we in this paper propose a novel tensor-based graph
learning framework that simultaneously considers consistency and specificity
for multi-view clustering. Specifically, we calculate the similarity distance
on the Stiefel manifold to preserve the intrinsic structure among data points.
By making an assumption that the learned neighbor graph of each view comprises
both a consistent graph and a view-specific graph, we formulate a new
tensor-based target graph learning paradigm. Owing to the benefits of tensor
singular value decomposition (t-SVD) in uncovering high-order correlations,
this model is capable of achieving a complete understanding of the target
graph. Furthermore, we develop an iterative algorithm to solve the proposed
objective optimization problem. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets
have demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed method over some
state-of-the-art multi-view clustering methods. The source code has been
released on https://github.com/lshi91/CSTGL-Code.

                                        <span>  In class-incremental learning (CIL) scenarios, the phenomenon of catastrophic
forgetting caused by the classifier's bias towards the current task has long
posed a significant challenge. It is mainly caused by the characteristic of
discriminative models. With the growing popularity of the generative
multi-modal models, we would explore replacing discriminative models with
generative ones for CIL. However, transitioning from discriminative to
generative models requires addressing two key challenges. The primary challenge
lies in transferring the generated textual information into the classification
of distinct categories. Additionally, it requires formulating the task of CIL
within a generative framework. To this end, we propose a novel generative
multi-modal model (GMM) framework for class-incremental learning. Our approach
directly generates labels for images using an adapted generative model. After
obtaining the detailed text, we use a text encoder to extract text features and
employ feature matching to determine the most similar label as the
classification prediction. In the conventional CIL settings, we achieve
significantly better results in long-sequence task scenarios. Under the
Few-shot CIL setting, we have improved by at least 14\% accuracy over all the
current state-of-the-art methods with significantly less forgetting. Our code
is available at \url{https://github.com/DoubleClass/GMM}.

batteries is crucial for maintaining the safe and stable operation of
rechargeable battery management systems. However, this task is often
challenging due to the complex temporal dynamics involved. Recently,
attention-based networks, such as Transformers and Informer, have been the
popular architecture in time series forecasting. Despite their effectiveness,
these models with abundant parameters necessitate substantial training time to
unravel temporal patterns. To tackle these challenges, we propose a simple
MLP-Mixer-based architecture named 'Intra-Inter Patch Mixer' (IIP-Mixer), which
is an architecture based exclusively on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs),
extracting information by mixing operations along both intra-patch and
inter-patch dimensions for battery RUL prediction. The proposed IIP-Mixer
comprises parallel dual-head mixer layers: the intra-patch mixing MLP,
capturing local temporal patterns in the short-term period, and the inter-patch
mixing MLP, capturing global temporal patterns in the long-term period.
Notably, to address the varying importance of features in RUL prediction, we
introduce a weighted loss function in the MLP-Mixer-based architecture, marking
the first time such an approach has been employed. Our experiments demonstrate
that IIP-Mixer achieves competitive performance in battery RUL prediction,
outperforming other popular time-series frameworks

                                        <span>  Synchronous federated learning (FL) is a popular paradigm for collaborative
edge learning. It typically involves a set of heterogeneous devices locally
training neural network (NN) models in parallel with periodic centralized
aggregations. As some of the devices may have limited computational resources
and varying availability, FL latency is highly sensitive to stragglers.
Conventional approaches discard incomplete intra-model updates done by
stragglers, alter the amount of local workload and architecture, or resort to
asynchronous settings; which all affect the trained model performance under
tight training latency constraints. In this work, we propose straggler-aware
layer-wise federated learning (SALF) that leverages the optimization procedure
of NNs via backpropagation to update the global model in a layer-wise fashion.
SALF allows stragglers to synchronously convey partial gradients, having each
layer of the global model be updated independently with a different
contributing set of users. We provide a theoretical analysis, establishing
convergence guarantees for the global model under mild assumptions on the
distribution of the participating devices, revealing that SALF converges at the
same asymptotic rate as FL with no timing limitations. This insight is matched
with empirical observations, demonstrating the performance gains of SALF
compared to alternative mechanisms mitigating the device heterogeneity gap in
FL.

AxoNN, a novel four-dimensional (4D) parallelization approach, inspired by
Agarwal's algorithm for matrix multiplication, for parallelizing tensor
computations in deep learning, AxoNN employs two key strategies to minimize

expensive collective operations (reduce-scatter, all-gather, all-reduce) with
computations. Our experiments with a 20-billion parameter transformer model
demonstrate that these optimizations deliver nearly 53\% improvement. Second,
we present an analytical model to assist users in identifying
communication-minimizing configurations within the vast search space defined by
our 4D algorithm. This model empowers practitioners by simplifying the tuning
process for their specific training workloads. When training an 80-billion

state-of-the-art framework, by a significant 26%. Additionally, it achieves 57%
of the theoretical peak FLOP/s.

                                        <span>  A fundamental question in theoretical machine learning is generalization.
Over the past decades, the PAC-Bayesian approach has been established as a
flexible framework to address the generalization capabilities of machine
learning algorithms, and design new ones. Recently, it has garnered increased
interest due to its potential applicability for a variety of learning
algorithms, including deep neural networks. In parallel, an
information-theoretic view of generalization has developed, wherein the
relation between generalization and various information measures has been
established. This framework is intimately connected to the PAC-Bayesian
approach, and a number of results have been independently discovered in both
strands. In this monograph, we highlight this strong connection and present a
unified treatment of PAC-Bayesian and information-theoretic generalization
bounds. We present techniques and results that the two perspectives have in
common, and discuss the approaches and interpretations that differ. In
particular, we demonstrate how many proofs in the area share a modular
structure, through which the underlying ideas can be intuited. We pay special
attention to the conditional mutual information (CMI) framework; analytical
studies of the information complexity of learning algorithms; and the
application of the proposed methods to deep learning. This monograph is
intended to provide a comprehensive introduction to information-theoretic
generalization bounds and their connection to PAC-Bayes, serving as a
foundation from which the most recent developments are accessible. It is aimed
broadly towards researchers with an interest in generalization and theoretical
machine learning.

                                        <span>  Diffusion models have recently gained traction as a powerful class of deep
generative priors, excelling in a wide range of image restoration tasks due to
their exceptional ability to model data distributions. To solve image
restoration problems, many existing techniques achieve data consistency by
incorporating additional likelihood gradient steps into the reverse sampling
process of diffusion models. However, the additional gradient steps pose a
challenge for real-world practical applications as they incur a large
computational overhead, thereby increasing inference time. They also present
additional difficulties when using accelerated diffusion model samplers, as the
number of data consistency steps is limited by the number of reverse sampling
steps. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based image restoration
solver that addresses these issues by decoupling the reverse process from the
data consistency steps. Our method involves alternating between a
reconstruction phase to maintain data consistency and a refinement phase that
enforces the prior via diffusion purification. Our approach demonstrates
versatility, making it highly adaptable for efficient problem-solving in latent
space. Additionally, it reduces the necessity for numerous sampling steps
through the integration of consistency models. The efficacy of our approach is
validated through comprehensive experiments across various image restoration
tasks, including image denoising, deblurring, inpainting, and super-resolution.

                                        <span>  Recently, a large number of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites have been
launched and deployed successfully in space by commercial companies, such as
SpaceX. Due to multimodal sensors equipped by the LEO satellites, they serve
not only for communication but also for various machine learning applications,
such as space modulation recognition, remote sensing image classification, etc.
However, the ground station (GS) may be incapable of downloading such a large
volume of raw sensing data for centralized model training due to the limited
contact time with LEO satellites (e.g. 5 minutes). Therefore, federated
learning (FL) has emerged as the promising solution to address this problem via
on-device training. Unfortunately, to enable FL on LEO satellites, we still
face three critical challenges that are i) heterogeneous computing and memory
capabilities, ii) limited uplink rate, and iii) model staleness. To this end,
we propose FedSN as a general FL framework to tackle the above challenges, and
fully explore data diversity on LEO satellites. Specifically, we first present
a novel sub-structure scheme to enable heterogeneous local model training
considering different computing, memory, and communication constraints on LEO
satellites. Additionally, we propose a pseudo-synchronous model aggregation
strategy to dynamically schedule model aggregation for compensating model
staleness. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of the FedSN, we evaluate
it using space modulation recognition and remote sensing image classification
tasks by leveraging the data from real-world satellite networks. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that FedSN framework achieves higher accuracy,
lower computing, and communication overhead than the state-of-the-art
benchmarks and the effectiveness of each components in FedSN.

Schr\"odinger Bridge (DSB) that facilitates its unification with Score-based
Generative Models (SGMs), addressing the limitations of DSB in complex data
generation and enabling faster convergence and enhanced performance. By
employing SGMs as an initial solution for DSB, our approach capitalizes on the
strengths of both frameworks, ensuring a more efficient training process and
improving the performance of SGM. We also propose a reparameterization
technique that, despite theoretical approximations, practically improves the
network's fitting capabilities. Our extensive experimental evaluations confirm
the effectiveness of the simplified DSB, demonstrating its significant
improvements. We believe the contributions of this work pave the way for
advanced generative modeling. The code is available at

                                        <span>  Discriminatively trained, deterministic neural networks are the de facto
choice for classification problems. However, even though they achieve
state-of-the-art results on in-domain test sets, they tend to be overconfident
on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. For instance, ReLU networks - a popular
class of neural network architectures - have been shown to almost always yield
high confidence predictions when the test data are far away from the training
set, even when they are trained with OOD data. We overcome this problem by
adding a term to the output of the neural network that corresponds to the logit
of an extra class, that we design to dominate the logits of the original
classes as we move away from the training data.This technique provably prevents
arbitrarily high confidence on far-away test data while maintaining a simple
discriminative point-estimate training. Evaluation on various benchmarks
demonstrates strong performance against competitive baselines on both far-away
and realistic OOD data.

significant progress, they still fall short in speech quality, similarity, and
prosody. Considering speech intricately encompasses various attributes (e.g.,
content, prosody, timbre, and acoustic details) that pose significant
challenges for generation, a natural idea is to factorize speech into
individual subspaces representing different attributes and generate them
individually. Motivated by it, we propose NaturalSpeech 3, a TTS system with
novel factorized diffusion models to generate natural speech in a zero-shot
way. Specifically, 1) we design a neural codec with factorized vector
quantization (FVQ) to disentangle speech waveform into subspaces of content,
prosody, timbre, and acoustic details; 2) we propose a factorized diffusion
model to generate attributes in each subspace following its corresponding
prompt. With this factorization design, NaturalSpeech 3 can effectively and
efficiently model intricate speech with disentangled subspaces in a
divide-and-conquer way. Experiments show that NaturalSpeech 3 outperforms the
state-of-the-art TTS systems on quality, similarity, prosody, and
intelligibility, and achieves on-par quality with human recordings.
Furthermore, we achieve better performance by scaling to 1B parameters and 200K
hours of training data.

for non-exchangeable data that formulates it as risk-sensitive policy
optimization. We develop the Inside-Out SMC$^2$ algorithm, a nested sequential
Monte Carlo technique to infer optimal designs, and embed it into a particle
Markov chain Monte Carlo framework to perform gradient-based policy
amortization. Our approach is distinct from other amortized experimental design
techniques, as it does not rely on contrastive estimators. Numerical validation
on a set of dynamical systems showcases the efficacy of our method in
comparison to other state-of-the-art strategies.

community structures which serves as a crucial feature of real-world graphs.
Detecting communities in graphs is a challenging problem with applications in
sociology, biology, and computer science. Despite the efforts of an
interdisciplinary community of scientists, a satisfactory solution to this
problem has not yet been achieved. This review article delves into the topic of
community detection in graphs, which serves as a thorough exposition of various
community detection methods from perspectives of modularity-based method,
spectral clustering, probabilistic modelling, and deep learning. Along with the
methods, a new community detection method designed by us is also presented.
Additionally, the performance of these methods on the datasets with and without
ground truth is compared. In conclusion, this comprehensive review provides a
deep understanding of community detection in graphs.

in real-world engineering applications. Yet, conventional neural networks often
fall short in addressing both simultaneously, or even separately. Drawing
insights from natural physical systems and existing literature, it is known
that an input convex architecture enhances computational efficiency, while a
Lipschitz-constrained architecture bolsters non-adversarial robustness. By
leveraging the strengths of convexity and Lipschitz continuity, we develop a
novel network architecture, termed Input Convex Lipschitz Recurrent Neural
Networks. This model is explicitly designed for fast and robust
optimization-based tasks and outperforms existing recurrent units across a
spectrum of engineering tasks in terms of computational efficiency and
non-adversarial robustness, including real-world solar irradiance prediction
for Solar PV system planning at LHT Holdings in Singapore and real-time Model
Predictive Control optimization for a nonlinear chemical reactor.

consumers on their devices but due to its performance and ability to converse
effectively, it has gained a huge popularity amongst research as well as
industrial community. Recently, many studies have been published to show the
effectiveness, efficiency, integration, and sentiments of chatGPT and other
LLMs. In contrast, this study focuses on the important aspects that are mostly
overlooked, i.e. sustainability, privacy, digital divide, and ethics and
suggests that not only chatGPT but every subsequent entry in the category of
conversational bots should undergo Sustainability, PrivAcy, Digital divide, and
Ethics (SPADE) evaluation. This paper discusses in detail the issues and
concerns raised over chatGPT in line with aforementioned characteristics. We
also discuss the recent EU AI Act briefly in accordance with the SPADE
evaluation. We support our hypothesis by some preliminary data collection and
visualizations along with hypothesized facts. We also suggest mitigations and
recommendations for each of the concerns. Furthermore, we also suggest some
policies and recommendations for EU AI policy act concerning ethics, digital
divide, and sustainability.

solve the bottlenecks of data management and promote intelligent
decision-making. However, this centralized architecture is limited by the
proliferation of data sources and the growing demand for timely analysis and
processing. A new data paradigm, Data Mesh, is proposed to overcome these
challenges. Data Mesh treats domains as a first-class concern by distributing
the data ownership from the central team to each data domain, while keeping the
federated governance to monitor domains and their data products. Many
multi-million dollar organizations like Paypal, Netflix, and Zalando have
already transformed their data analysis pipelines based on this new
architecture. In this decentralized architecture where data is locally
preserved by each domain team, traditional centralized machine learning is
incapable of conducting effective analysis across multiple domains, especially
for security-sensitive organizations. To this end, we introduce a pioneering
approach that incorporates Federated Learning into Data Mesh. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first open-source applied work that represents a
critical advancement toward the integration of federated learning methods into
the Data Mesh paradigm, underscoring the promising prospects for
privacy-preserving and decentralized data analysis strategies within Data Mesh
architecture.

                                        <span>  Motivated by applications in large-scale and multi-agent reinforcement
learning, we study the non-asymptotic performance of stochastic approximation
(SA) schemes with delayed updates under Markovian sampling. While the effect of
delays has been extensively studied for optimization, the manner in which they
interact with the underlying Markov process to shape the finite-time
performance of SA remains poorly understood. In this context, our first main
contribution is to show that under time-varying bounded delays, the delayed SA
update rule guarantees exponentially fast convergence of the \emph{last
iterate} to a ball around the SA operator's fixed point. Notably, our bound is
\emph{tight} in its dependence on both the maximum delay $\tau_{max}$, and the
mixing time $\tau_{mix}$. To achieve this tight bound, we develop a novel
inductive proof technique that, unlike various existing delayed-optimization
analyses, relies on establishing uniform boundedness of the iterates. As such,
our proof may be of independent interest. Next, to mitigate the impact of the
maximum delay on the convergence rate, we provide the first finite-time
analysis of a delay-adaptive SA scheme under Markovian sampling. In particular,
we show that the exponent of convergence of this scheme gets scaled down by
$\tau_{avg}$, as opposed to $\tau_{max}$ for the vanilla delayed SA rule; here,
$\tau_{avg}$ denotes the average delay across all iterations. Moreover, the
adaptive scheme requires no prior knowledge of the delay sequence for step-size
tuning. Our theoretical findings shed light on the finite-time effects of
delays for a broad class of algorithms, including TD learning, Q-learning, and
stochastic gradient descent under Markovian sampling.

learning (Open-set SSL) considers a more practical scenario, where unlabeled
data and test data contain new categories (outliers) not observed in labeled
data (inliers). Most previous works focused on outlier detection via binary
classifiers, which suffer from insufficient scalability and inability to
distinguish different types of uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework, Adaptive Negative Evidential Deep Learning (ANEDL) to tackle these
limitations. Concretely, we first introduce evidential deep learning (EDL) as
an outlier detector to quantify different types of uncertainty, and design
different uncertainty metrics for self-training and inference. Furthermore, we
propose a novel adaptive negative optimization strategy, making EDL more
tailored to the unlabeled dataset containing both inliers and outliers. As
demonstrated empirically, our proposed method outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods across four datasets.

biographical information in the context of digital humanities and related
subjects. There is a growing interest in the community to build datasets
capable of training machine learning models to extract relationships. However,
annotating such datasets can be expensive and time-consuming, in addition to
being limited to English. This paper applies guided distant supervision to
create a large biographical relationship extraction dataset for German. Our
dataset, composed of more than 80,000 instances for nine relationship types, is
the largest biographical German relationship extraction dataset. We also create
a manually annotated dataset with 2000 instances to evaluate the models and
release it together with the dataset compiled using guided distant supervision.
We train several state-of-the-art machine learning models on the automatically
created dataset and release them as well. Furthermore, we experiment with
multilingual and cross-lingual experiments that could benefit many low-resource
languages.

Byzantine attacks and data heterogeneity. A novel Robust Average Gradient
Algorithm (RAGA) is proposed, which leverages the geometric median for
aggregation and can freely select the round number for local updating.
Different from most existing resilient approaches, which perform convergence
analysis based on strongly-convex loss function or homogeneously distributed
dataset, we conduct convergence analysis for not only strongly-convex but also
non-convex loss function over heterogeneous dataset. According to our
theoretical analysis, as long as the fraction of dataset from malicious users
is less than half, RAGA can achieve convergence at rate
$\mathcal{O}({1}/{T^{2/3- \delta}})$ where $T$ is the iteration number and
$\delta \in (0, 2/3)$ for non-convex loss function, and at linear rate for
strongly-convex loss function. Moreover, stationary point or global optimal
solution is proved to obtainable as data heterogeneity vanishes. Experimental
results corroborate the robustness of RAGA to Byzantine attacks and verifies
the advantage of RAGA over baselines on convergence performance under various
intensity of Byzantine attacks, for heterogeneous dataset.

to one of the most debated forms of online manipulation. Yet, social bot
research is plagued by widespread biases, hyped results, and misconceptions
that set the stage for ambiguities, unrealistic expectations, and seemingly
irreconcilable findings. Overcoming such issues is instrumental towards
ensuring reliable solutions and reaffirming the validity of the scientific
method. In this contribution, we review some recent results in social bots
research, highlighting and revising factual errors as well as methodological
and conceptual biases. More importantly, we demystify common misconceptions,
addressing fundamental points on how social bots research is discussed. Our
analysis surfaces the need to discuss research about online disinformation and
manipulation in a rigorous, unbiased, and responsible way. This article
bolsters such effort by identifying and refuting common fallacious arguments
used by both proponents and opponents of social bots research, as well as
providing directions toward sound methodologies for future research in the
field.

                                        <span>  Audio classification aims at recognizing audio signals, including speech
commands or sound events. However, current audio classifiers are susceptible to
perturbations and adversarial attacks. In addition, real-world audio
classification tasks often suffer from limited labeled data. To help bridge
these gaps, previous work developed neuro-inspired convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) with sparse coding via the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA)
in the first layer (i.e., LCANets) for computer vision. LCANets learn in a
combination of supervised and unsupervised learning, reducing dependency on
labeled samples. Motivated by the fact that auditory cortex is also sparse, we
extend LCANets to audio recognition tasks and introduce LCANets++, which are
CNNs that perform sparse coding in multiple layers via LCA. We demonstrate that
LCANets++ are more robust than standard CNNs and LCANets against perturbations,
e.g., background noise, as well as black-box and white-box attacks, e.g.,
evasion and fast gradient sign (FGSM) attacks.

                                        <span>  Recently, the use of transformers in offline reinforcement learning has
become a rapidly developing area. This is due to their ability to treat the
agent's trajectory in the environment as a sequence, thereby reducing the
policy learning problem to sequence modeling. In environments where the agent's
decisions depend on past events, it is essential to capture both the event
itself and the decision point in the context of the model. However, the
quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism limits the potential for
context expansion. One solution to this problem is to enhance transformers with
memory mechanisms. In this paper, we propose the Recurrent Action Transformer
with Memory (RATE) - a model that incorporates recurrent memory. To evaluate
our model, we conducted extensive experiments on both memory-intensive
environments (VizDoom-Two-Color, T-Maze) and classic Atari games and MuJoCo
control environments. The results show that the use of memory can significantly
improve performance in memory-intensive environments while maintaining or
improving results in classic environments. We hope that our findings will
stimulate research on memory mechanisms for transformers applicable to offline
reinforcement learning.

Anomaly-detection with Convolutional Embedding and Generative Pre-trained
Transformers. TRACE-GPT is designed to pre-train univariate time-series sensor
data and detect faults on unlabeled datasets in semiconductor manufacturing. In
semiconductor industry, classifying abnormal time-series sensor data from
normal data is important because it is directly related to wafer defect.
However, small, unlabeled, and even mixed training data without enough
anomalies make classification tasks difficult. In this research, we capture
features of time-series data with temporal convolutional embedding and
Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) to classify abnormal sequences from
normal sequences using cross entropy loss. We prove that our model shows better
performance than previous unsupervised models with both an open dataset, the
University of California Riverside (UCR) time-series classification archive,
and the process log of our Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) equipment. Our model
has the highest F1 score at Equal Error Rate (EER) across all datasets and is
only 0.026 below the supervised state-of-the-art baseline on the open dataset.

                                        <span>  Bilateral trade models the problem of intermediating between two rational
agents -- a seller and a buyer -- both characterized by a private valuation for
an item they want to trade. We study the online learning version of the
problem, in which at each time step a new seller and buyer arrive and the
learner has to set prices for them without any knowledge about their
(adversarially generated) valuations.
  In this setting, known impossibility results rule out the existence of
no-regret algorithms when budget balanced has to be enforced at each time step.
In this paper, we introduce the notion of \emph{global budget balance}, which
only requires the learner to fulfill budget balance over the entire time
horizon. Under this natural relaxation, we provide the first no-regret
algorithms for adversarial bilateral trade under various feedback models.
First, we show that in the full-feedback model, the learner can guarantee
$\tilde O(\sqrt{T})$ regret against the best fixed prices in hindsight, and
that this bound is optimal up to poly-logarithmic terms. Second, we provide a
learning algorithm guaranteeing a $\tilde O(T^{3/4})$ regret upper bound with
one-bit feedback, which we complement with a $\Omega(T^{5/7})$ lower bound that
holds even in the two-bit feedback model. Finally, we introduce and analyze an
alternative benchmark that is provably stronger than the best fixed prices in
hindsight and is inspired by the literature on bandits with knapsacks.

                                        <span>  The advent of instruction-tuned language models that convincingly mimic human
writing poses a significant risk of abuse. However, such abuse may be
counteracted with the ability to detect whether a piece of text was composed by
a language model rather than a human author. Some previous approaches to this
problem have relied on supervised methods by training on corpora of confirmed
human- and machine- written documents. Unfortunately, model under-specification
poses an unavoidable challenge for neural network-based detectors, making them
brittle in the face of data shifts, such as the release of newer language
models producing still more fluent text than the models used to train the
detectors. Other approaches require access to the models that may have
generated a document in question, which is often impractical. In light of these
challenges, we pursue a fundamentally different approach not relying on samples
from language models of concern at training time. Instead, we propose to
leverage representations of writing style estimated from human-authored text.
Indeed, we find that features effective at distinguishing among human authors
are also effective at distinguishing human from machine authors, including
state-of-the-art large language models like Llama-2, ChatGPT, and GPT-4.
Furthermore, given a handful of examples composed by each of several specific
language models of interest, our approach affords the ability to predict which
model generated a given document. The code and data to reproduce our
experiments are available at

process. State-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) can simplify writing
variation generation. However, current interfaces pose challenges for
simultaneous consideration of multiple variations: creating new variations
without overwriting text can be difficult, and pasting them sequentially can
clutter documents, increasing workload and disrupting writers' flow. To tackle
this, we present ABScribe, an interface that supports rapid, yet visually
structured, exploration and organization of writing variations in human-AI
co-writing tasks. With ABScribe, users can swiftly modify variations using LLM
prompts, which are auto-converted into reusable buttons. Variations are stored
adjacently within text fields for rapid in-place comparisons using mouse-over
interactions on a popup toolbar. Our user study with 12 writers shows that
ABScribe significantly reduces task workload (d = 1.20, p < 0.001), enhances
user perceptions of the revision process (d = 2.41, p < 0.001) compared to a
popular baseline workflow, and provides insights into how writers explore
variations using LLMs.

                                        <span>  Partial-label learning (PLL) is an important weakly supervised learning
problem, which allows each training example to have a candidate label set
instead of a single ground-truth label. Identification-based methods have been
widely explored to tackle label ambiguity issues in PLL, which regard the true
label as a latent variable to be identified. However, identifying the true
labels accurately and completely remains challenging, causing noise in pseudo
labels during model training. In this paper, we propose a new method called
CroSel, which leverages historical predictions from the model to identify true
labels for most training examples. First, we introduce a cross selection
strategy, which enables two deep models to select true labels of partially
labeled data for each other. Besides, we propose a novel consistency
regularization term called co-mix to avoid sample waste and tiny noise caused
by false selection. In this way, CroSel can pick out the true labels of most
examples with high precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority
of CroSel, which consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on
benchmark datasets. Additionally, our method achieves over 90\% accuracy and
quantity for selecting true labels on CIFAR-type datasets under various
settings.

                                        <span>  Piecewise Polynomials (PPs) are utilized in several engineering disciplines,
like trajectory planning, to approximate position profiles given in the form of
a set of points. While the approximation target along with domain-specific
requirements, like Ck -continuity, can be formulated as a system of equations
and a result can be computed directly, such closed-form solutions posses
limited flexibility with respect to polynomial degrees, polynomial bases or
adding further domain-specific requirements. Sufficiently complex optimization
goals soon call for the use of numerical methods, like gradient descent. Since
gradient descent lies at the heart of training Artificial Neural Networks
(ANNs), modern Machine Learning (ML) frameworks like TensorFlow come with a set
of gradient-based optimizers potentially suitable for a wide range of
optimization problems beyond the training task for ANNs. Our approach is to
utilize the versatility of PP models and combine it with the potential of
modern ML optimizers for the use in function approximation in 1D trajectory
planning in the context of electronic cam design. We utilize available
optimizers of the ML framework TensorFlow directly, outside of the scope of
ANNs, to optimize model parameters of our PP model. In this paper, we show how
an orthogonal polynomial basis contributes to improving approximation and
continuity optimization performance. Utilizing Chebyshev polynomials of the
first kind, we develop a novel regularization approach enabling clearly
improved convergence behavior. We show that, using this regularization
approach, Chebyshev basis performs better than power basis for all relevant
optimizers in the combined approximation and continuity optimization setting
and demonstrate usability of the presented approach within the electronic cam
domain.

                                        <span>  While multi-task learning (MTL) has gained significant attention in recent
years, its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Recent methods did
not yield consistent performance improvements over single task learning (STL)
baselines, underscoring the importance of gaining more profound insights about
challenges specific to MTL. In our study, we challenge paradigms in MTL in the
context of STL: First, the impact of the choice of optimizer has only been
mildly investigated in MTL. We show the pivotal role of common STL tools such
as the Adam optimizer in MTL empirically in various experiments. To further
investigate Adam's effectiveness, we theoretical derive a partial loss-scale
invariance under mild assumptions. Second, the notion of gradient conflicts has
often been phrased as a specific problem in MTL. We delve into the role of
gradient conflicts in MTL and compare it to STL. For angular gradient alignment
we find no evidence that this is a unique problem in MTL. We emphasize
differences in gradient magnitude as the main distinguishing factor. Lastly, we
compare the transferability of features learned through MTL and STL on common
image corruptions, and find light evidence that MTL can lead to superior
transferability. Overall, we find surprising similarities between STL and MTL
suggesting to consider methods from both fields in a broader context.

                                        <span>  Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D
human pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video
pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices.
In this paper, we present a plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering framework,
called Hourglass Tokenizer (HoT), for efficient transformer-based 3D human pose
estimation from videos. Our HoT begins with pruning pose tokens of redundant
frames and ends with recovering full-length tokens, resulting in a few pose
tokens in the intermediate transformer blocks and thus improving the model
efficiency. To effectively achieve this, we propose a token pruning cluster
(TPC) that dynamically selects a few representative tokens with high semantic
diversity while eliminating the redundancy of video frames. In addition, we
develop a token recovering attention (TRA) to restore the detailed
spatio-temporal information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the
network output to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast
inference. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (i.e., Human3.6M and
MPI-INF-3DHP) demonstrate that our method can achieve both high efficiency and
estimation accuracy compared to the original VPT models. For instance, applying
to MotionBERT and MixSTE on Human3.6M, our HoT can save nearly 50% FLOPs
without sacrificing accuracy and nearly 40% FLOPs with only 0.2% accuracy drop,
respectively. Code and models are available at
https://github.com/NationalGAILab/HoT.

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) based large language models (LLMs), we train and
release OpenMoE, a series of fully open-sourced and reproducible decoder-only
MoE LLMs, ranging from 650M to 34B parameters and trained on up to over 1T
tokens. Our investigation confirms that MoE-based LLMs can offer a more
favorable cost-effectiveness trade-off than dense LLMs, highlighting the
potential effectiveness for future LLM development.
  One more important contribution of this study is an in-depth analysis of the
routing mechanisms within our OpenMoE models, leading to three significant
findings: Context-Independent Specialization, Early Routing Learning, and
Drop-towards-the-End. We discovered that routing decisions in MoE models are
predominantly based on token IDs, with minimal context relevance. The
token-to-expert assignments are determined early in the pre-training phase and
remain largely unchanged. This imperfect routing can result in performance
degradation, particularly in sequential tasks like multi-turn conversations,
where tokens appearing later in a sequence are more likely to be dropped.
Finally, we rethink our design based on the above-mentioned observations and
analysis. To facilitate future MoE LLM development, we propose potential
strategies for mitigating the issues we found and further improving
off-the-shelf MoE LLM designs.

classification. While existing methods, such as SMOTE-based approaches,
partially mitigate this issue, they still exhibit limitations in constructing
imbalanced graphs. Generative self-supervised learning (SSL) methods,
exemplified by graph autoencoders (GAEs), offer a promising solution by
directly generating minority nodes from the data itself, yet their potential
remains underexplored. In this paper, we delve into the shortcomings of
SMOTE-based approaches in the construction of imbalanced graphs. Furthermore,
we introduce VIGraph, a simple yet effective generative SSL approach that
relies on the Variational GAE as the fundamental model. VIGraph strictly
adheres to the concept of imbalance when constructing imbalanced graphs and
innovatively leverages the variational inference (VI) ability of Variational
GAE to generate nodes for minority classes. VIGraph introduces comprehensive
training strategies, including cross-view contrastive learning at the decoding
phase to capture semantic knowledge, adjacency matrix reconstruction to
preserve graph structure, and alignment strategy to ensure stable training.
VIGraph can generate high-quality nodes directly usable for classification,
eliminating the need to integrate the generated nodes back to the graph as well
as additional retraining found in SMOTE-based methods. We conduct extensive
experiments, results from which demonstrate the superiority and generality of
our approach.

segmentation from different image modalities. Existing state-of-the-art methods
focus on a single modality, despite the wide range of available cerebrovascular
imaging techniques. This can lead to significant distribution shifts that
negatively impact the generalization across modalities. By relying on annotated
angiographies and a limited number of annotated venographies, our framework
accomplishes image-to-image translation and semantic segmentation, leveraging a
disentangled and semantically rich latent space to represent heterogeneous data
and perform image-level adaptation from source to target domains. Moreover, we
reduce the typical complexity of cycle-based architectures and minimize the use
of adversarial training, which allows us to build an efficient and intuitive
model with stable training. We evaluate our method on magnetic resonance
angiographies and venographies. While achieving state-of-the-art performance in
the source domain, our method attains a Dice score coefficient in the target
domain that is only 8.9% lower, highlighting its promising potential for robust
cerebrovascular image segmentation across different modalities.

                                        <span>  Offline pretraining with a static dataset followed by online fine-tuning
(offline-to-online, or OtO) is a paradigm well matched to a real-world RL
deployment process. In this scenario, we aim to find the best-performing policy
within a limited budget of online interactions. Previous work in the OtO
setting has focused on correcting for bias introduced by the policy-constraint
mechanisms of offline RL algorithms. Such constraints keep the learned policy
close to the behavior policy that collected the dataset, but we show this can
unnecessarily limit policy performance if the behavior policy is far from
optimal. Instead, we forgo constraints and frame OtO RL as an exploration
problem that aims to maximize the benefit of online data-collection. We first
study the major online RL exploration methods based on intrinsic rewards and
UCB in the OtO setting, showing that intrinsic rewards add training instability
through reward-function modification, and UCB methods are myopic and it is
unclear which learned-component's ensemble to use for action selection. We then
introduce an algorithm for planning to go out-of-distribution (PTGOOD) that
avoids these issues. PTGOOD uses a non-myopic planning procedure that targets
exploration in relatively high-reward regions of the state-action space
unlikely to be visited by the behavior policy. By leveraging concepts from the
Conditional Entropy Bottleneck, PTGOOD encourages data collected online to
provide new information relevant to improving the final deployment policy
without altering rewards. We show empirically in several continuous control
tasks that PTGOOD significantly improves agent returns during online
fine-tuning and avoids the suboptimal policy convergence that many of our
baselines exhibit in several environments.

acoustic room data from multiple modalities. The dataset includes high-quality
and densely captured room impulse response data paired with multi-view images,
and precise 6DoF pose tracking data for sound emitters and listeners in the
rooms. We used this dataset to evaluate existing methods for novel-view
acoustic synthesis and impulse response generation which previously relied on
synthetic data. In our evaluation, we thoroughly assessed existing audio and
audio-visual models against multiple criteria and proposed settings to enhance
their performance on real-world data. We also conducted experiments to
investigate the impact of incorporating visual data (i.e., images and depth)
into neural acoustic field models. Additionally, we demonstrated the
effectiveness of a simple sim2real approach, where a model is pre-trained with
simulated data and fine-tuned with sparse real-world data, resulting in
significant improvements in the few-shot learning approach. RAF is the first
dataset to provide densely captured room acoustic data, making it an ideal
resource for researchers working on audio and audio-visual neural acoustic
field modeling techniques. Demos and datasets are available on our project

                                        <span>  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly adept at generating
contextually detailed and coherent responses from visual inputs. However, their
application in multimodal decision-making and open-ended generation is hindered
by a notable rate of hallucinations, where generated text inaccurately
represents the visual contents. To address this issue, this paper introduces
the Instruction Contrastive Decoding (ICD) method, a novel approach designed to
reduce hallucinations during LVLM inference. Our method is inspired by our
observation that what we call disturbance instructions significantly exacerbate
hallucinations in multimodal fusion modules. ICD contrasts distributions from
standard and instruction disturbance, thereby increasing alignment uncertainty
and effectively subtracting hallucinated concepts from the original
distribution. Through comprehensive experiments on discriminative benchmarks
(POPE and MME) and a generative benchmark (LLaVa-Bench), we demonstrate that
ICD significantly mitigates both object-level and attribute-level
hallucinations. Moreover, our method not only addresses hallucinations but also
significantly enhances the general perception and recognition capabilities of
LVLMs.

traditional image quality assessment (IQA) on natural scenarios, AGIs quality
assessment (AGIQA) takes the correspondence of image and its textual prompt
into consideration. This is coupled in the ground truth score, which confuses
the unimodal IQA methods. To solve this problem, we introduce IP-IQA (AGIs
Quality Assessment via Image and Prompt), a multimodal framework for AGIQA via
corresponding image and prompt incorporation. Specifically, we propose a novel
incremental pretraining task named Image2Prompt for better understanding of
AGIs and their corresponding textual prompts. An effective and efficient
image-prompt fusion module, along with a novel special [QA] token, are also
applied. Both are plug-and-play and beneficial for the cooperation of image and
its corresponding prompt. Experiments demonstrate that our IP-IQA achieves the
state-of-the-art on AGIQA-1k and AGIQA-3k datasets. Code will be available.

services that involve video, audio, and haptic contents are expected to become
the dominant multimedia service in the near future. Edge caching is a key
technology that can significantly reduce network load and content transmission
latency, which is critical for the delivery of multi-modal contents. However,
existing caching approaches only rely on a limited number of factors, e.g.,
popularity, to evaluate their importance for caching, which is inefficient for
caching multi-modal contents, especially in dynamic network environments. To
overcome this issue, we propose a content importance-based caching scheme which
consists of a content importance evaluation model and a caching model. By
leveraging dueling double deep Q networks (D3QN) model, the content importance
evaluation model can adaptively evaluate contents' importance in dynamic
networks. Based on the evaluated contents' importance, the caching model can
easily cache and evict proper contents to improve caching efficiency. The
simulation results show that the proposed content importance-based caching
scheme outperforms existing caching schemes in terms of caching hit ratio (at
least 15% higher), reduced network load (up to 22% reduction), average number
of hops (up to 27% lower), and unsatisfied requests ratio (more than 47%
reduction).

                                        <span>  Visual representation learning has been a cornerstone in computer vision,
evolving from supervised learning with human-annotated labels to aligning
image-text pairs from the Internet. Despite recent advancements in multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs), the visual representations they rely on, such as
CLIP embeddings, often lack access to external world knowledge critical for
real-world visual reasoning. In this work, we propose Visual Table, a novel
visual representation tailored for MLLMs. It provides hierarchical text
descriptions of holistic visual scenes, consisting of a scene description and
multiple object-centric descriptions that encompass categories, attributes, and
knowledge at instance level. We further develop a scalable generator for visual
table generation and train it on small-scale annotations from GPT4V. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that, with generated visual tables as additional visual
representations, our model can consistently outperform the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) MLLMs across diverse benchmarks. When visual tables serve as standalone
visual representations, our model can closely match or even beat the SOTA MLLMs
that are built on CLIP visual embeddings. Our code is available at

growing video understanding applications at resource-constrained IoT devices.
Recent efforts have been made to enhance the scalability of such systems by
reducing inference costs on edge servers. However, existing research is not
directly applicable to pixel-level vision tasks such as video semantic
segmentation (VSS), partly due to the fluctuating VSS accuracy and segment
bitrate caused by the dynamic video content. In response, we present Penance, a
new edge inference cost reduction framework. By exploiting softmax outputs of
VSS models and the prediction mechanism of H.264/AVC codecs, Penance optimizes
model selection and compression settings to minimize the inference cost while
meeting the required accuracy within the available bandwidth constraints. We
implement Penance in a commercial IoT device with only CPUs. Experimental
results show that Penance consumes a negligible 6.8% more computation resources
than the optimal strategy while satisfying accuracy and bandwidth constraints
with a low failure rate.

                                        <span>  No-reference point cloud quality assessment (NR-PCQA) aims to automatically
evaluate the perceptual quality of distorted point clouds without available
reference, which have achieved tremendous improvements due to the utilization
of deep neural networks. However, learning-based NR-PCQA methods suffer from
the scarcity of labeled data and usually perform suboptimally in terms of
generalization. To solve the problem, we propose a novel contrastive
pre-training framework tailored for PCQA (CoPA), which enables the pre-trained
model to learn quality-aware representations from unlabeled data. To obtain
anchors in the representation space, we project point clouds with different
distortions into images and randomly mix their local patches to form mixed
images with multiple distortions. Utilizing the generated anchors, we constrain
the pre-training process via a quality-aware contrastive loss following the
philosophy that perceptual quality is closely related to both content and
distortion. Furthermore, in the model fine-tuning stage, we propose a
semantic-guided multi-view fusion module to effectively integrate the features
of projected images from multiple perspectives. Extensive experiments show that
our method outperforms the state-of-the-art PCQA methods on popular benchmarks.
Further investigations demonstrate that CoPA can also benefit existing
learning-based PCQA models.

models have as revolutionized the fields of NLP and computer vision
respectively. However, their slow inference, high computation and memory
requirement makes it challenging to deploy them on edge devices. In this study,
we propose a light-weight quantization aware fine tuning technique using
knowledge distillation (KD-QAT) to improve the performance of 4-bit weight
quantized LLMs using commonly available datasets to realize a popular language
use case, on device chat applications. To improve this paradigm of finetuning,
as main contributions, we provide insights into stability of KD-QAT by
empirically studying the gradient propagation during training to better
understand the vulnerabilities of KD-QAT based approaches to low-bit
quantization errors. Based on our insights, we propose ov-freeze, a simple
technique to stabilize the KD-QAT process. Finally, we experiment with the
popular 7B LLaMAv2-Chat model at 4-bit quantization level and demonstrate that
ov-freeze results in near float-point precision performance, i.e., less than
0.7% loss of accuracy on Commonsense Reasoning benchmarks.

domain experts and higher cost of employing them. While Large Language Models
(LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in data annotation tasks on
general domain datasets, their effectiveness on domain specific datasets
remains underexplored. To address this gap, we investigate the potential of
LLMs as efficient data annotators for extracting relations in financial
documents. We compare the annotations produced by three LLMs (GPT-4, PaLM 2,
and MPT Instruct) against expert annotators and crowdworkers. We demonstrate
that the current state-of-the-art LLMs can be sufficient alternatives to
non-expert crowdworkers. We analyze models using various prompts and parameter
settings and find that customizing the prompts for each relation group by
providing specific examples belonging to those groups is paramount.
Furthermore, we introduce a reliability index (LLM-RelIndex) used to identify
outputs that may require expert attention. Finally, we perform an extensive
time, cost and error analysis and provide recommendations for the collection
and usage of automated annotations in domain-specific settings.

these models generate empathic messages in response to posts describing common
life experiences, such as workplace situations, parenting, relationships, and
other anxiety- and anger-eliciting situations. Across two studies (N=192, 202),
we showed human raters a variety of responses written by several models (GPT4
Turbo, Llama2, and Mistral), and had people rate these responses on how
empathic they seemed to be. We found that LLM-generated responses were
consistently rated as more empathic than human-written responses. Linguistic
analyses also show that these models write in distinct, predictable ``styles",
in terms of their use of punctuation, emojis, and certain words. These results
highlight the potential of using LLMs to enhance human peer support in contexts
where empathy is important.

                                        <span>  The high computational cost associated with pretraining large language models
limits their research. Two strategies have emerged to address this issue:
domain specialization and pretraining with high-quality data. To explore these
strategies, we specialized the Sabi\'a-2 Small model with 1.9 billion unique
tokens from reputable Brazilian legal sources and conducted few-shot
evaluations on legal and general knowledge exams. Our model, Juru, demonstrates
the benefits of domain specialization with a reduced amount of pretraining
data. However, this specialization comes at the expense of degrading
performance in other knowledge areas within the same language. This study
contributes to the growing body of scientific evidence showing that pretraining
data selection may enhance the performance of large language models, enabling
the exploration of these models at a lower cost.

Portuguese texts. The models are evaluated on a diverse range of exams,
including entry-level tests for Brazilian universities, professional
certification exams, and graduate-level exams for various disciplines such as
accounting, economics, engineering, law and medicine. Our results reveal that
our best model so far, Sabi\'a-2 Medium, matches or surpasses GPT-4's
performance in 23 out of 64 exams and outperforms GPT-3.5 in 58 out of 64
exams. Notably, specialization has a significant impact on a model's
performance without the need to increase its size, allowing us to offer
Sabi\'a-2 Medium at a price per token that is 10 times cheaper than GPT-4.
Finally, we identified that math and coding are key abilities that need
improvement.

generated by large language models to human preferences. We hypothesize that
state-of-the-art instructional image editing models, where outputs are
generated based on an input image and an editing instruction, could similarly
benefit from human feedback, as their outputs may not adhere to the correct
instructions and preferences of users. In this paper, we present a novel
framework to harness human feedback for instructional visual editing (HIVE).
Specifically, we collect human feedback on the edited images and learn a reward
function to capture the underlying user preferences. We then introduce scalable
diffusion model fine-tuning methods that can incorporate human preferences
based on the estimated reward. Besides, to mitigate the bias brought by the
limitation of data, we contribute a new 1M training dataset, a 3.6K reward
dataset for rewards learning, and a 1K evaluation dataset to boost the
performance of instructional image editing. We conduct extensive empirical
experiments quantitatively and qualitatively, showing that HIVE is favored over
previous state-of-the-art instructional image editing approaches by a large
margin.

redirected to more nuanced aspects, intricate phenomena, as well as potential
risks that may arise from the widespread use of MT tools. Along this line, this
paper offers a meticulous assessment of three commercial MT systems - Google
Translate, DeepL, and Modern MT - with a specific focus on gender translation
and bias. For three language pairs (English/Spanish, English/Italian, and
English/French), we scrutinize the behavior of such systems at several levels
of granularity and on a variety of naturally occurring gender phenomena in
translation. Our study takes stock of the current state of online MT tools, by
revealing significant discrepancies in the gender translation of the three
systems, with each system displaying varying degrees of bias despite their
overall translation quality.

                                        <span>  Adapting language models (LMs) to novel domains is often achieved through
fine-tuning a pre-trained LM (PLM) on domain-specific data. Fine-tuning
introduces new knowledge into an LM, enabling it to comprehend and efficiently
perform a target domain task. Fine-tuning can however be inadvertently
insensitive if it ignores the wide array of disparities (e.g in word meaning)
between source and target domains. For instance, words such as chronic and
pressure may be treated lightly in social conversations, however, clinically,
these words are usually an expression of concern. To address insensitive
fine-tuning, we propose Mask Specific Language Modeling (MSLM), an approach
that efficiently acquires target domain knowledge by appropriately weighting
the importance of domain-specific terms (DS-terms) during fine-tuning. MSLM
jointly masks DS-terms and generic words, then learns mask-specific losses by
ensuring LMs incur larger penalties for inaccurately predicting DS-terms
compared to generic words. Results of our analysis show that MSLM improves LMs
sensitivity and detection of DS-terms. We empirically show that an optimal
masking rate not only depends on the LM, but also on the dataset and the length
of sequences. Our proposed masking strategy outperforms advanced masking
strategies such as span- and PMI-based masking.

transformative changes. It is our perspective that the community should accept
this opportunity to re-center our research agendas on societal needs while
dismantling the artificial separation between the work on fairness,
accountability, transparency, and ethics in IR and the rest of IR research.
Instead of adopting a reactionary strategy of trying to mitigate potential
social harms from emerging technologies, the community should aim to
proactively set the research agenda for the kinds of systems we should build
inspired by diverse explicitly stated sociotechnical imaginaries. The
sociotechnical imaginaries that underpin the design and development of
information access technologies needs to be explicitly articulated, and we need
to develop theories of change in context of these diverse perspectives. Our
guiding future imaginaries must be informed by other academic fields, such as
democratic theory and critical theory, and should be co-developed with social
science scholars, legal scholars, civil rights and social justice activists,

                                        <span>  Digital news platforms use news recommenders as the main instrument to cater
to the individual information needs of readers. Despite an increasingly
language-diverse online community, in which many Internet users consume news in
multiple languages, the majority of news recommendation focuses on major,
resource-rich languages, and English in particular. Moreover, nearly all news
recommendation efforts assume monolingual news consumption, whereas more and
more users tend to consume information in at least two languages. Accordingly,
the existing body of work on news recommendation suffers from a lack of
publicly available multilingual benchmarks that would catalyze development of
news recommenders effective in multilingual settings and for low-resource
languages. Aiming to fill this gap, we introduce xMIND, an open, multilingual
news recommendation dataset derived from the English MIND dataset using machine
translation, covering a set of 14 linguistically and geographically diverse
languages, with digital footprints of varying sizes. Using xMIND, we
systematically benchmark several state-of-the-art content-based neural news
recommenders (NNRs) in both zero-shot (ZS-XLT) and few-shot (FS-XLT)
cross-lingual transfer scenarios, considering both monolingual and bilingual
news consumption patterns. Our findings reveal that (i) current NNRs, even when
based on a multilingual language model, suffer from substantial performance
losses under ZS-XLT and that (ii) inclusion of target-language data in FS-XLT
training has limited benefits, particularly when combined with a bilingual news
consumption. Our findings thus warrant a broader research effort in
multilingual and cross-lingual news recommendation. The xMIND dataset is
available at https://github.com/andreeaiana/xMIND.

processing (NLP) resources by introducing ArabicaQA, the first large-scale
dataset for machine reading comprehension and open-domain question answering in
Arabic. This comprehensive dataset, consisting of 89,095 answerable and 3,701
unanswerable questions created by crowdworkers to look similar to answerable
ones, along with additional labels of open-domain questions marks a crucial
advancement in Arabic NLP resources. We also present AraDPR, the first dense
passage retrieval model trained on the Arabic Wikipedia corpus, specifically
designed to tackle the unique challenges of Arabic text retrieval. Furthermore,
our study includes extensive benchmarking of large language models (LLMs) for
Arabic question answering, critically evaluating their performance in the
Arabic language context. In conclusion, ArabicaQA, AraDPR, and the benchmarking
of LLMs in Arabic question answering offer significant advancements in the

the decisions made by the judges and the opinions of lawyers towards a given
case. This relevance is referred to as the case-to-case reference relation. To
efficiently find relevant cases from a large case pool, retrieval tools are
widely used by legal practitioners. Existing legal case retrieval models mainly
work by comparing the text representations of individual cases. Although they
obtain a decent retrieval accuracy, the intrinsic case connectivity
relationships among cases have not been well exploited for case encoding,
therefore limiting the further improvement of retrieval performance. In a case
pool, there are three types of case connectivity relationships: the case
reference relationship, the case semantic relationship, and the case legal
charge relationship. Due to the inductive manner in the task of legal case
retrieval, using case reference as input is not applicable for testing. Thus,
in this paper, a CaseLink model based on inductive graph learning is proposed
to utilise the intrinsic case connectivity for legal case retrieval, a novel
Global Case Graph is incorporated to represent both the case semantic
relationship and the case legal charge relationship. A novel contrastive
objective with a regularisation on the degree of case nodes is proposed to
leverage the information carried by the case reference relationship to optimise
the model. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two benchmark datasets,
which demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CaseLink. The code has
been released on https://github.com/yanran-tang/CaseLink.

introduces a new scoring strategy and a distillation process consisting in the

queries, each associated with a set of documents retrieved via four distinct
retrieval methods to ensure diversity, and then reranked by exploiting the
zero-shot reranking capabilities of an LLM. Our ablation studies demonstrate
the contribution of each new component we introduced. Our experimental results
show that TWOLAR significantly enhances the document reranking ability of the
underlying model, matching and in some cases even outperforming
state-of-the-art models with three orders of magnitude more parameters on the
TREC-DL test sets and the zero-shot evaluation benchmark BEIR. To facilitate
future work we release our data set, finetuned models, and code.

                                        <span>  Cold-start rating prediction is a fundamental problem in recommender systems
that has been extensively studied. Many methods have been proposed that exploit
explicit relations among existing data, such as collaborative filtering, social
recommendations and heterogeneous information network, to alleviate the data
insufficiency issue for cold-start users and items. However, the explicit
relations constructed based on data between different roles may be unreliable
and irrelevant, which limits the performance ceiling of the specific
recommendation task. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose a flexible
framework dubbed heterogeneous interaction rating network (HIRE). HIRE dose not
solely rely on the pre-defined interaction pattern or the manually constructed
heterogeneous information network. Instead, we devise a Heterogeneous
Interaction Module (HIM) to jointly model the heterogeneous interactions and
directly infer the important interactions via the observed data. In the
experiments, we evaluate our model under three cold-start settings on three
real-world datasets. The experimental results show that HIRE outperforms other
baselines by a large margin. Furthermore, we visualize the inferred
interactions of HIRE to confirm the contribution of our model.

                                        <span>  To capture user preference, transformer models have been widely applied to
model sequential user behavior data. The core of transformer architecture lies
in the self-attention mechanism, which computes the pairwise attention scores
in a sequence. Due to the permutation-equivariant nature, positional encoding
is used to enhance the attention between token representations. In this
setting, the pairwise attention scores can be derived by both semantic
difference and positional difference. However, prior studies often model the
two kinds of difference measurements in different ways, which potentially
limits the expressive capacity of sequence modeling. To address this issue,
this paper proposes a novel transformer variant with complex vector attention,
named EulerFormer, which provides a unified theoretical framework to formulate
both semantic difference and positional difference. The EulerFormer involves
two key technical improvements. First, it employs a new transformation function
for efficiently transforming the sequence tokens into polar-form complex
vectors using Euler's formula, enabling the unified modeling of both semantic
and positional information in a complex rotation form.Secondly, it develops a
differential rotation mechanism, where the semantic rotation angles can be
controlled by an adaptation function, enabling the adaptive integration of the
semantic and positional information according to the semantic
contexts.Furthermore, a phase contrastive learning task is proposed to improve
the anisotropy of contextual representations in EulerFormer. Our theoretical
framework possesses a high degree of completeness and generality. It is more
robust to semantic variations and possesses moresuperior theoretical properties
in principle. Extensive experiments conducted on four public datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

                                        <span>  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted
considerable interest among researchers to leverage these models to enhance
Recommender Systems (RSs). Existing work predominantly utilizes LLMs to
generate knowledge-rich texts or utilizes LLM-derived embeddings as features to
improve RSs. Although the extensive world knowledge embedded in LLMs generally
benefits RSs, the application can only take limited number of users and items
as inputs, without adequately exploiting collaborative filtering information.
Considering its crucial role in RSs, one key challenge in enhancing RSs with
LLMs lies in providing better collaborative filtering information through LLMs.
In this paper, drawing inspiration from the in-context learning and chain of
thought reasoning in LLMs, we propose the Large Language Models enhanced
Collaborative Filtering (LLM-CF) framework, which distils the world knowledge
and reasoning capabilities of LLMs into collaborative filtering. We also
explored a concise and efficient instruction-tuning method, which improves the
recommendation capabilities of LLMs while preserving their general
functionalities (e.g., not decreasing on the LLM benchmark). Comprehensive
experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that LLM-CF significantly
enhances several backbone recommendation models and consistently outperforms
competitive baselines, showcasing its effectiveness in distilling the world
knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLM into collaborative filtering.

infinite data streams. The core idea behind S+t-SNE is to update the t-SNE
embedding incrementally as new data arrives, ensuring scalability and
adaptability to handle streaming scenarios. By selecting the most important
points at each step, the algorithm ensures scalability while keeping
informative visualisations. Employing a blind method for drift management
adjusts the embedding space, facilitating continuous visualisation of evolving

                                        <span>  Reinforcement Learning-based Recommender Systems (RLRS) have shown promise
across a spectrum of applications, from e-commerce platforms to streaming
services. Yet, they grapple with challenges, notably in crafting reward
functions and harnessing large pre-existing datasets within the RL framework.
Recent advancements in offline RLRS provide a solution for how to address these
two challenges. However, existing methods mainly rely on the transformer
architecture, which, as sequence lengths increase, can introduce challenges
associated with computational resources and training costs. Additionally, the
prevalent methods employ fixed-length input trajectories, restricting their
capacity to capture evolving user preferences. In this study, we introduce a
new offline RLRS method to deal with the above problems. We reinterpret the
RLRS challenge by modeling sequential decision-making as an inference task,
leveraging adaptive masking configurations. This adaptive approach selectively
masks input tokens, transforming the recommendation task into an inference
challenge based on varying token subsets, thereby enhancing the agent's ability
to infer across diverse trajectory lengths. Furthermore, we incorporate a
multi-scale segmented retention mechanism that facilitates efficient modeling
of long sequences, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. Our
experimental analysis, conducted on both online simulator and offline datasets,
clearly demonstrates the advantages of our proposed method.

                                        <span>  In recommendation systems, users frequently engage in multiple types of
behaviors, such as clicking, adding to a cart, and purchasing. However, with
diversified behavior data, user behavior sequences will become very long in the
short term, which brings challenges to the efficiency of the sequence
recommendation model. Meanwhile, some behavior data will also bring inevitable
noise to the modeling of user interests. To address the aforementioned issues,
firstly, we develop the Efficient Behavior Sequence Miner (EBM) that
efficiently captures intricate patterns in user behavior while maintaining low
time complexity and parameter count. Secondly, we design hard and soft
denoising modules for different noise types and fully explore the relationship
between behaviors and noise. Finally, we introduce a contrastive loss function
along with a guided training strategy to compare the valid information in the
data with the noisy signal, and seamlessly integrate the two denoising
processes to achieve a high degree of decoupling of the noisy signal.
Sufficient experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our approach in dealing with multi-behavior sequential
recommendation.

from large collections based on a limited set of example documents. Previous
research has highlighted Positive and Unlabeled (PU) learning as a promising
approach for this task. However, most PU methods rely on the unrealistic
assumption of knowing the class prior for positive samples in the collection.
To address this limitation, this paper introduces a novel PU learning framework
that utilizes intractable density estimation models. Experiments conducted on
PubMed and Covid datasets in a transductive setting showcase the effectiveness
of the proposed method for DSE. Code is available from

recommendations focus more on how to touch the core conversions, which are
highly related to the interests of platforms. These core conversions are
usually continuous targets, such as \textit{watch time}, \textit{revenue}, and
so on, whose predictions can be enhanced by previous discrete conversion
actions. Therefore, multi-task learning (MTL) can be adopted as the paradigm to
learn these hybrid targets. However, existing works mainly emphasize
investigating the sequential dependence among discrete conversion actions,
which neglects the complexity of dependence between discrete conversions and
the final continuous conversion. Moreover, simultaneously optimizing hybrid
tasks with stronger task dependence will suffer from volatile issues where the
core regression task might have a larger influence on other tasks. In this
paper, we study the MTL problem with hybrid targets for the first time and
propose the model named Hybrid Targets Learning Network (HTLNet) to explore
task dependence and enhance optimization. Specifically, we introduce label
embedding for each task to explicitly transfer the label information among
these tasks, which can effectively explore logical task dependence. We also
further design the gradient adjustment regime between the final regression task
and other classification tasks to enhance the optimization. Extensive
experiments on two offline public datasets and one real-world industrial
dataset are conducted to validate the effectiveness of HTLNet. Moreover, online
A/B tests on the financial recommender system also show our model has superior
improvement.

                                        <span>  In real-world advertising systems, conversions have different types in nature
and ads can be shown in different display scenarios, both of which highly
impact the actual conversion rate (CVR). This results in the multi-type and
multi-scenario CVR prediction problem. A desired model for this problem should
satisfy the following requirements: 1) Accuracy: the model should achieve
fine-grained accuracy with respect to any conversion type in any display
scenario. 2) Scalability: the model parameter size should be affordable. 3)
Convenience: the model should not require a large amount of effort in data
partitioning, subset processing and separate storage. Existing approaches
cannot simultaneously satisfy these requirements. For example, building a
separate model for each (conversion type, display scenario) pair is neither
scalable nor convenient. Building a unified model trained on all the data with
conversion type and display scenario included as two features is not accurate
enough. In this paper, we propose the Masked Multi-domain Network (MMN) to
solve this problem. To achieve the accuracy requirement, we model
domain-specific parameters and propose a dynamically weighted loss to account
for the loss scale imbalance issue within each mini-batch. To achieve the
scalability requirement, we propose a parameter sharing and composition
strategy to reduce model parameters from a product space to a sum space. To
achieve the convenience requirement, we propose an auto-masking strategy which
can take mixed data from all the domains as input. It avoids the overhead
caused by data partitioning, individual processing and separate storage. Both
offline and online experimental results validate the superiority of MMN for
multi-type and multi-scenario CVR prediction. MMN is now the serving model for
real-time CVR prediction in UC Toutiao.

                                        <span>  Collaborative filtering methods based on graph neural networks (GNNs) have
witnessed significant success in recommender systems (RS), capitalizing on
their ability to capture collaborative signals within intricate user-item
relationships via message-passing mechanisms. However, these GNN-based RS
inadvertently introduce excess linear correlation between user and item
embeddings, contradicting the goal of providing personalized recommendations.
While existing research predominantly ascribes this flaw to the over-smoothing
problem, this paper underscores the critical, often overlooked role of the
over-correlation issue in diminishing the effectiveness of GNN representations
and subsequent recommendation performance. Up to now, the over-correlation
issue remains unexplored in RS. Meanwhile, how to mitigate the impact of
over-correlation while preserving collaborative filtering signals is a
significant challenge. To this end, this paper aims to address the
aforementioned gap by undertaking a comprehensive study of the over-correlation
issue in graph collaborative filtering models. Firstly, we present empirical
evidence to demonstrate the widespread prevalence of over-correlation in these
models. Subsequently, we dive into a theoretical analysis which establishes a
pivotal connection between the over-correlation and over-smoothing issues.
Leveraging these insights, we introduce the Adaptive Feature De-correlation
Graph Collaborative Filtering (AFDGCF) framework, which dynamically applies
correlation penalties to the feature dimensions of the representation matrix,
effectively alleviating both over-correlation and over-smoothing issues. The
efficacy of the proposed framework is corroborated through extensive
experiments conducted with four representative graph collaborative filtering
models across four publicly available datasets.

                                        <span>  Recently, web platforms have been operating various service domains
simultaneously. Targeting a platform that operates multiple service domains, we
introduce a new task, Multi-Domain Recommendation to Attract Users (MDRAU),
which recommends items from multiple ``unseen'' domains with which each user
has not interacted yet, by using knowledge from the user's ``seen'' domains. In
this paper, we point out two challenges of MDRAU task. First, there are
numerous possible combinations of mappings from seen to unseen domains because
users have usually interacted with a different subset of service domains.
Second, a user might have different preferences for each of the target unseen
domains, which requires that recommendations reflect the user's preferences on
domains as well as items. To tackle these challenges, we propose DRIP framework
that models users' preferences at two levels (i.e., domain and item) and learns
various seen-unseen domain mappings in a unified way with masked domain
modeling. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DRIP in
MDRAU task and its ability to capture users' domain-level preferences.

based on historical interactions. While many SR approaches concentrate on user
IDs and item IDs, the human perception of the world through multi-modal
signals, like text and images, has inspired researchers to delve into
constructing SR from multi-modal information without using IDs. However, the
complexity of multi-modal learning manifests in diverse feature extractors,
fusion methods, and pre-trained models. Consequently, designing a simple and
universal \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{M}odal \textbf{S}equential
\textbf{R}ecommendation (\textbf{MMSR}) framework remains a formidable
challenge. We systematically summarize the existing multi-modal related SR
methods and distill the essence into four core components: visual encoder, text
encoder, multimodal fusion module, and sequential architecture. Along these
dimensions, we dissect the model designs, and answer the following
sub-questions: First, we explore how to construct MMSR from scratch, ensuring
its performance either on par with or exceeds existing SR methods without
complex techniques. Second, we examine if MMSR can benefit from existing
multi-modal pre-training paradigms. Third, we assess MMSR's capability in
tackling common challenges like cold start and domain transferring. Our
experiment results across four real-world recommendation scenarios demonstrate
the great potential ID-agnostic multi-modal sequential recommendation. Our
framework can be found at: https://github.com/MMSR23/MMSR.

confirmation biases, tend to select search results that confirm their existing
beliefs on socially significant contentious issues. To understand the judgments
and attitude changes of users searching online, our study examined how
cognitively biased users interact with algorithmically biased search engine
result pages (SERPs). We designed three-query search sessions on debated topics
under various bias conditions. We recruited 1,321 crowdsourcing participants
and explored their attitude changes, search interactions, and the effects of
confirmation bias. Three key findings emerged: 1) most attitude changes occur
in the initial query of a search session; 2) confirmation bias and result
presentation on SERPs affect search behaviors in the current query and
perceived familiarity with clicked results in subsequent queries. The bias
position also affect attitude changes of users with lower perceived openness to
conflicting opinions; 3) Interactions in the first query and and dwell time
throughout the session are associated with users' attitude changes in different
forms. Our study goes beyond traditional simulation-based evaluation settings
and simulated rational users, sheds light on the mixed effects of human biases
and algorithmic biases in controversial information retrieval tasks, and can
inform the design of bias-aware user models, human-centered bias mitigation
techniques, and socially responsible intelligent IR systems.

                                        <span>  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various research domains, including the field of Information Retrieval (IR).
However, the responses generated by off-the-shelf LLMs tend to be generic,
i.e., cannot capture the distinctiveness of each document with similar content.
This limits the performance of LLMs in IR because finding and distinguishing
relevant documents from substantial similar documents is a typical problem in
many IR tasks. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised alignment
method, namely Reinforcement Learning from Contrastive Feedback (RLCF),
empowering LLMs to generate both high-quality and context-specific responses.
Our approach constructs unsupervised contrastive feedback signals based on
similar document groups, and adopts a reward function, named group-wise
reciprocal rank, to optimize LLMs within a standard Proximal Policy
Optimization. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of
RLCF on LLMs built with different languages and parameter sizes on multiple
downstream IR applications. RLCF significantly outperforms existing alignment
methods, and RLCF-optimized LLMs demonstrate considerable improvement in
generating responses with distinctiveness.

                                        <span>  Click-through prediction (CTR) models transform features into latent vectors
and enumerate possible feature interactions to improve performance based on the
input feature set. Therefore, when selecting an optimal feature set, we should
consider the influence of both feature and its interaction. However, most
previous works focus on either feature field selection or only select feature
interaction based on the fixed feature set to produce the feature set. The
former restricts search space to the feature field, which is too coarse to
determine subtle features. They also do not filter useless feature
interactions, leading to higher computation costs and degraded model
performance. The latter identifies useful feature interaction from all
available features, resulting in many redundant features in the feature set. In
this paper, we propose a novel method named OptFS to address these problems. To
unify the selection of feature and its interaction, we decompose the selection
of each feature interaction into the selection of two correlated features. Such
a decomposition makes the model end-to-end trainable given various feature
interaction operations. By adopting feature-level search space, we set a
learnable gate to determine whether each feature should be within the feature
set. Because of the large-scale search space, we develop a
learning-by-continuation training scheme to learn such gates. Hence, OptFS
generates the feature set only containing features which improve the final
prediction results. Experimentally, we evaluate OptFS on three public datasets,
demonstrating OptFS can optimize feature sets which enhance the model
performance and further reduce both the storage and computational cost.

                                        <span>  Collaborative filtering is a critical technique in recommender systems. Among
various methods, an increasingly popular paradigm is to reconstruct user-item
interactions based on the historical observations. This can be viewed as a
conditional generative task, where recently developed diffusion model
demonstrates great potential. However, existing studies on diffusion models
lack effective solutions for modeling implicit feedback data. Particularly, the
isotropic nature of the standard diffusion process fails to account for the
heterogeneous dependencies among items, leading to a misalignment with the
graphical structure of the interaction space. Meanwhile, random noise
destroying personalized information in interaction vectors, causing difficulty
in reverse reconstruction. In this paper, we make novel adaptions of diffusion
model and propose Graph Signal Diffusion Model for Collaborative Filtering
(named GiffCF). To better represent the high-dimensional and sparse
distribution of implicit feedback, we define a generalized form of denoising
diffusion using heat equation on the item-item similarity graph. Our forward
process smooths interaction signals with an advanced family of graph filters.
Hence, instead of losing information, it involves item-item similarities as
beneficial prior knowledge for recommendation. To reconstruct high-quality
interactions, our reverse process iteratively refines and sharpens preference
signals in a deterministic manner, where the update direction is conditioned on
the user history and computed from a carefully designed two-stage denoiser.
Finally, through extensive experiments, we show that GiffCF effectively
leverages the advantages of both diffusion model and graph signal processing,
and achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets.

                                        <span>  We evaluated 20+ Transformer models for ranking of long documents (including
recent LongP models trained with FlashAttention) and compared them with simple
FirstP baselines (applying the same model to input truncated to the first 512
tokens). We used MS MARCO Documents v1 as a primary training set and evaluated
models in the zero-shot scenario as well as after fine-tuning on other
collections.
  In our initial experiments with standard collections we found that
long-document models underperformed FirstP or outperformed it by at most 5% on
average in terms of MRR or NDCG. We then conjectured that this was not due to
models inability to process long context but rather due to a positional bias of
relevant passages, which tended to be among the first 512 document tokens. We
found evidence that this bias was, indeed, present in at least two test sets,
which motivated us to create a new collection MS MARCO FarRelevant where the
relevant passages were not present among the first 512 tokens.
  Unlike standard collections where we observed both little benefit from
incorporating longer contexts and limited variability in model performance
(within a few %), experiments on MS MARCO FarRelevant uncovered dramatic
differences among models. FirstP models performed roughly at the
random-baseline level in both zero-shot and fine-tuning scenarios. Simple
aggregation models (e.g., MaxP) had good zero-shot accuracy but benefited
little from fine-tuning. Most other models had poor zero-shot performance
(sometimes at a random baseline level) but outstripped MaxP by as much 13-28\%
after finetuning. Thus, positional bias not only diminishes benefits of
processing longer document contexts but also leads to model overfitting to this
bias and performing poorly in a zero-shot setting when a distribution of
relevant passages changes substantially.
  We make our software and MS MARCO FarRelevant available.

                                        <span>  Recent research shows that pre-trained language models (PLMs) suffer from
"prompt bias" in factual knowledge extraction, i.e., prompts tend to introduce
biases toward specific labels. Prompt bias presents a significant challenge in
assessing the factual knowledge within PLMs. Therefore, this paper aims to
improve the reliability of existing benchmarks by thoroughly investigating and
mitigating prompt bias. We show that: 1) all prompts in the experiments exhibit
non-negligible bias, with gradient-based prompts like AutoPrompt and OptiPrompt
displaying significantly higher levels of bias; 2) prompt bias can amplify
benchmark accuracy unreasonably by overfitting the test datasets, especially on
imbalanced datasets like LAMA. Based on these findings, we propose a
representation-based approach to mitigate the prompt bias during inference
time. Specifically, we first estimate the biased representation using
prompt-only querying, and then remove it from the model's internal
representations to generate the debiased representations, which are used to
produce the final debiased outputs. Experiments across various prompts, PLMs,
and benchmarks show that our approach can not only correct the overfitted
performance caused by prompt bias, but also significantly improve the prompt
retrieval capability (up to 10% absolute performance gain). These results
indicate that our approach effectively alleviates prompt bias in knowledge
evaluation, thereby enhancing the reliability of benchmark assessments.
Hopefully, our plug-and-play approach can be a golden standard to strengthen
PLMs toward reliable knowledge bases. Code and data are released in

                                        <span>  Sequential recommendation systems are integral to discerning temporal user
preferences. Yet, the task of learning from abbreviated user interaction
sequences poses a notable challenge. Data augmentation has been identified as a
potent strategy to enhance the informational richness of these sequences.
Traditional augmentation techniques, such as item randomization, may disrupt
the inherent temporal dynamics. Although recent advancements in reverse
chronological pseudo-item generation have shown promise, they can introduce
temporal discrepancies when assessed in a natural chronological context. In
response, we introduce a sophisticated approach, Bidirectional temporal data
Augmentation with pre-training (BARec). Our approach leverages bidirectional
temporal augmentation and knowledge-enhanced fine-tuning to synthesize
authentic pseudo-prior items that \emph{retain user preferences and capture
deeper item semantic correlations}, thus boosting the model's expressive power.
Our comprehensive experimental analysis confirms the superiority of BARec
across both short and elongated sequence contexts. Moreover, theoretical
examination and visual representation of item embeddings offer further insight
into the model's logical processes and interpretability. The source code for
our study is available at

                                        <span>  Transformers used in vision have been investigated through diverse
architectures - ViT, PVT, and Swin. These have worked to improve the attention
mechanism and make it more efficient. Differently, the need for including local
information was felt, leading to incorporating convolutions in transformers
such as CPVT and CvT. Global information is captured using a complex Fourier
basis to achieve global token mixing through various methods, such as AFNO,
GFNet, and Spectformer. We advocate combining three diverse views of data -
local, global, and long-range dependence. We also investigate the simplest
global representation using only the real domain spectral representation -
obtained through the Hartley transform. We use a convolutional operator in the
initial layers to capture local information. Through these two contributions,
we are able to optimize and obtain a spectral convolution transformer (SCT)
that provides improved performance over the state-of-the-art methods while
reducing the number of parameters. Through extensive experiments, we show that
SCT-C-small gives state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet dataset and
reaches 84.5\% top-1 accuracy, while SCT-C-Large reaches 85.9\% and SCT-C-Huge
reaches 86.4\%. We evaluate SCT on transfer learning on datasets such as
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Oxford Flower, and Stanford Car. We also evaluate SCT on
downstream tasks i.e. instance segmentation on the MSCOCO dataset. The project

                                        <span>  Diffusion models have recently brought a powerful revolution in image
generation. Despite showing impressive generative capabilities, most of these
models rely on the current sample to denoise the next one, possibly resulting
in denoising instability. In this paper, we reinterpret the iterative denoising
process as model optimization and leverage a moving average mechanism to
ensemble all the prior samples. Instead of simply applying moving average to
the denoised samples at different timesteps, we first map the denoised samples
to data space and then perform moving average to avoid distribution shift
across timesteps. In view that diffusion models evolve the recovery from
low-frequency components to high-frequency details, we further decompose the
samples into different frequency components and execute moving average
separately on each component. We name the complete approach "Moving Average
Sampling in Frequency domain (MASF)". MASF could be seamlessly integrated into
mainstream pre-trained diffusion models and sampling schedules. Extensive
experiments on both unconditional and conditional diffusion models demonstrate
that our MASF leads to superior performances compared to the baselines, with
almost negligible additional complexity cost.

of applications. However, capturing HDR content from real-world scenes is
expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, the challenging task of reconstructing
visually accurate HDR images from their Low Dynamic Range (LDR) counterparts is
gaining attention in the vision research community. A major challenge in this
research problem is the lack of datasets, which capture diverse scene
conditions (e.g., lighting, shadows, weather, locations, landscapes, objects,
humans, buildings) and various image features (e.g., color, contrast,
saturation, hue, luminance, brightness, radiance). To address this gap, in this
paper, we introduce GTA-HDR, a large-scale synthetic dataset of photo-realistic
HDR images sampled from the GTA-V video game. We perform thorough evaluation of
the proposed dataset, which demonstrates significant qualitative and
quantitative improvements of the state-of-the-art HDR image reconstruction
methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dataset
and its impact on additional computer vision tasks including 3D human pose
estimation, human body part segmentation, and holistic scene segmentation. The

limited time and interest in various topics to improve their learning
efficiency. To this end, video summarization has been actively researched to
enable users to view only important scenes from a video. However, these studies
focus on either the visual or audio information of a video and extract
important segments in the video. Therefore, there is a risk of missing
important information when both the teacher's speech and visual information on
the blackboard or slides are important, such as in a lecture video. To tackle
this issue, we propose FastPerson, a video summarization approach that
considers both the visual and auditory information in lecture videos.
FastPerson creates summary videos by utilizing audio transcriptions along with
on-screen images and text, minimizing the risk of overlooking crucial
information for learners. Further, it provides a feature that allows learners
to switch between the summary and original videos for each chapter of the
video, enabling them to adjust the pace of learning based on their interests
and level of understanding. We conducted an evaluation with 40 participants to
assess the effectiveness of our method and confirmed that it reduced viewing
time by 53\% at the same level of comprehension as that when using traditional
video playback methods.

maximizing the quality of immersive panoramic video services that match users'
personal preferences and habits has become a long-standing challenge.
Understanding the saliency region where users focus, based on data collected
with HMDs, can promote multimedia encoding, transmission, and quality
assessment. At the same time, large-scale datasets are essential for
researchers and developers to explore short/long-term user behavior patterns
and train AI models related to panoramic videos. However, existing panoramic
video datasets often include low-frequency user head or eye movement data
through short-term videos only, lacking sufficient data for analyzing users'
Field of View (FoV) and generating video saliency regions.
  Driven by these practical factors, in this paper, we present a head and eye
tracking dataset involving 50 users (25 males and 25 females) watching 15
panoramic videos. The dataset provides details on the viewport and gaze
attention locations of users. Besides, we present some statistics samples
extracted from the dataset. For example, the deviation between head and eye
movements challenges the widely held assumption that gaze attention decreases
from the center of the FoV following a Gaussian distribution. Our analysis
reveals a consistent downward offset in gaze fixations relative to the FoV in
experimental settings involving multiple users and videos. That's why we name
the dataset Panonut, a saliency weighting shaped like a donut. Finally, we also
provide a script that generates saliency distributions based on given head or
eye coordinates and pre-generated saliency distribution map sets of each video
from the collected eye tracking data.
  The dataset is available on website: https://dianvrlab.github.io/Panonut360/.

adapt them to various downstream classification tasks has garnered significant
attention in recent research. The adaptation strategies can be typically
categorized into three paradigms: zero-shot adaptation, few-shot adaptation,
and the recently-proposed training-free few-shot adaptation. Most existing
approaches are tailored for a specific setting and can only cater to one or two
of these paradigms. In this paper, we introduce a versatile adaptation approach
that can effectively work under all three settings. Specifically, we propose
the dual memory networks that comprise dynamic and static memory components.
The static memory caches training data knowledge, enabling training-free
few-shot adaptation, while the dynamic memory preserves historical test
features online during the testing process, allowing for the exploration of
additional data insights beyond the training set. This novel capability
enhances model performance in the few-shot setting and enables model usability
in the absence of training data. The two memory networks employ the same
flexible memory interactive strategy, which can operate in a training-free mode
and can be further enhanced by incorporating learnable projection layers. Our
approach is tested across 11 datasets under the three task settings.
Remarkably, in the zero-shot scenario, it outperforms existing methods by over
3\% and even shows superior results against methods utilizing external training
data. Additionally, our method exhibits robust performance against natural
distribution shifts. Codes are available at \url{https://github.com/YBZh/DMN}.

                                        <span>  The goal of the multi-sound source localization task is to localize sound
sources from the mixture individually. While recent multi-sound source
localization methods have shown improved performance, they face challenges due
to their reliance on prior information about the number of objects to be
separated. In this paper, to overcome this limitation, we present a novel
multi-sound source localization method that can perform localization without
prior knowledge of the number of sound sources. To achieve this goal, we
propose an iterative object identification (IOI) module, which can recognize
sound-making objects in an iterative manner. After finding the regions of
sound-making objects, we devise object similarity-aware clustering (OSC) loss
to guide the IOI module to effectively combine regions of the same object but
also distinguish between different objects and backgrounds. It enables our
method to perform accurate localization of sound-making objects without any
prior knowledge. Extensive experimental results on the MUSIC and VGGSound
benchmarks show the significant performance improvements of the proposed method
over the existing methods for both single and multi-source. Our code is

                                        <span>  This paper proposes a novel direct Audio-Visual Speech to Audio-Visual Speech
Translation (AV2AV) framework, where the input and output of the system are
multimodal (i.e., audio and visual speech). With the proposed AV2AV, two key
advantages can be brought: 1) We can perform real-like conversations with
individuals worldwide in a virtual meeting by utilizing our own primary
languages. In contrast to Speech-to-Speech Translation (A2A), which solely
translates between audio modalities, the proposed AV2AV directly translates
between audio-visual speech. This capability enhances the dialogue experience
by presenting synchronized lip movements along with the translated speech. 2)
We can improve the robustness of the spoken language translation system. By
employing the complementary information of audio-visual speech, the system can
effectively translate spoken language even in the presence of acoustic noise,
showcasing robust performance. To mitigate the problem of the absence of a
parallel AV2AV translation dataset, we propose to train our spoken language
translation system with the audio-only dataset of A2A. This is done by learning
unified audio-visual speech representations through self-supervised learning in
advance to train the translation system. Moreover, we propose an AV-Renderer
that can generate raw audio and video in parallel. It is designed with
zero-shot speaker modeling, thus the speaker in source audio-visual speech can
be maintained at the target translated audio-visual speech. The effectiveness
of AV2AV is evaluated with extensive experiments in a many-to-many language
translation setting. Demo page is available on

necessitates an ample supply of defective samples, a constraint often hindered
by their scarcity in industrial contexts. This paper introduces a novel
algorithm designed to augment defective samples, thereby enhancing AD
performance. The proposed method tailors the blended latent diffusion model for
defect sample generation, employing a diffusion model to generate defective
samples in the latent space. A feature editing process, controlled by a
``trimap" mask and text prompts, refines the generated samples. The image
generation inference process is structured into three stages: a free diffusion
stage, an editing diffusion stage, and an online decoder adaptation stage. This
sophisticated inference strategy yields high-quality synthetic defective
samples with diverse pattern variations, leading to significantly improved AD
accuracies based on the augmented training set. Specifically, on the widely
recognized MVTec AD dataset, the proposed method elevates the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance of AD with augmented data by 1.5%, 1.9%, and 3.1% for AD
metrics AP, IAP, and IAP90, respectively. The implementation code of this work

designing technology that caters to children's needs. However, determining what
aspects of context are relevant for designing child-centric technology remains
a challenge. We introduce EXPLORA, a multimodal, multistage online methodology
comprising three pivotal stages: (1) building a teacher-apprentice
relationship,(2) learning from child-teachers, and (3) assessing and
reinforcing researcher-apprentice learning. Central to EXPLORA is the
collection of attitudinal data through pre-observation interviews, offering
researchers a deeper understanding of children's characteristics and contexts.
This informs subsequent online observations, allowing researchers to focus on
frequent interactions. Furthermore, researchers can validate preliminary
assumptions with children. A means-ends analysis framework aids in the
systematic analysis of data, shedding light on context, agency and
homework-information searching processes children employ in their activities.
To illustrate EXPLORA's capabilities, we present nine single case studies
investigating Brazilian child-caregiver dyads' (children ages 9-11) use of
technology in homework information-searching.

of drug development. DDIs occur when one drug's properties are affected by the
inclusion of other drugs. Detecting favorable DDIs has the potential to pave
the way for creating and advancing innovative medications applicable in
practical settings. However, existing DDI prediction models continue to face
challenges related to generalization in extreme cases, robust feature
extraction, and real-life application possibilities. We aim to address these
challenges by leveraging the effectiveness of context-aware deep graph learning
by introducing a novel framework named CADGL. Based on a customized variational
graph autoencoder (VGAE), we capture critical structural and physio-chemical
information using two context preprocessors for feature extraction from two
different perspectives: local neighborhood and molecular context, in a
heterogeneous graphical structure. Our customized VGAE consists of a graph
encoder, a latent information encoder, and an MLP decoder. CADGL surpasses
other state-of-the-art DDI prediction models, excelling in predicting
clinically valuable novel DDIs, supported by rigorous case studies.

structure to capture the semantic essence of textual data. Then, a system
powered by large language models is designed and implemented to process
"semantic node" and generate AAS instance models from textual technical data.
Our evaluation demonstrates a 62-79% effective generation rate, indicating a
substantial proportion of manual creation effort can be converted into easier
validation effort, thereby reducing the time and cost in creating AAS instance
models. In our evaluation, a comparative analysis of different LLMs and an
in-depth ablation study of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanisms
provide insights into the effectiveness of LLM systems for interpreting
technical concepts. Our findings emphasize LLMs' capability in automating AAS
instance creation, enhancing semantic interoperability, and contributing to the
broader field of semantic interoperability for digital twins in industrial
applications. The prototype implementation and evaluation results are released
on our GitHub Repository with the link: https://github.com/YuchenXia/AASbyLLM

revolutionized the human-AI interaction and information-seeking process.
Leveraging LLMs as an alternative to search engines, users can now access
summarized information tailored to their queries, significantly reducing the
cognitive load associated with navigating vast information resources. This
shift underscores the potential of LLMs in redefining information access
paradigms. Drawing on the foundation of task-focused information retrieval and
LLMs' task planning ability, this research extends the scope of LLM
capabilities beyond routine task automation to support users in navigating
long-term and significant life tasks. It introduces the GOLF framework
(Goal-Oriented Long-term liFe tasks), which focuses on enhancing LLMs' ability
to assist in significant life decisions through goal orientation and long-term
planning. The methodology encompasses a comprehensive simulation study to test
the framework's efficacy, followed by model and human evaluations to develop a
dataset benchmark for long-term life tasks, and experiments across different
models and settings. By shifting the focus from short-term tasks to the broader
spectrum of long-term life goals, this research underscores the transformative

                                        <span>  Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based recommender systems have demonstrated
promising performance in meeting user expectations by learning to make accurate
next-item recommendations from historical user-item interactions. However,
existing offline RL-based sequential recommendation methods face the challenge
of obtaining effective user feedback from the environment. Effectively modeling
the user state and shaping an appropriate reward for recommendation remains a
challenge. In this paper, we leverage language understanding capabilities and
adapt large language models (LLMs) as an environment (LE) to enhance RL-based
recommenders. The LE is learned from a subset of user-item interaction data,
thus reducing the need for large training data, and can synthesise user
feedback for offline data by: (i) acting as a state model that produces high
quality states that enrich the user representation, and (ii) functioning as a
reward model to accurately capture nuanced user preferences on actions.
Moreover, the LE allows to generate positive actions that augment the limited
offline training data. We propose a LE Augmentation (LEA) method to further
improve recommendation performance by optimising jointly the supervised
component and the RL policy, using the augmented actions and historical user
signals. We use LEA, the state and reward models in conjunction with
state-of-the-art RL recommenders and report experimental results on two
publicly available datasets.

(FAO), the Global Soil Partnership (GSP) is a global network of stakeholders
promoting sound land and soil management practices towards a sustainable world
food system. However, soil survey largely remains a local or regional activity,
bound to heterogeneous methods and conventions. Recognising the relevance of
global and trans-national policies towards sustainable land management
practices, the GSP elected data harmonisation and exchange as one of its key
lines of action. Building upon international standards and previous work
towards a global soil data ontology, an improved domain model was eventually
developed within the GSP [54], the basis for a Global Soil Information System
(GloSIS). This work also identified the Semantic Web as a possible avenue to
operationalise the domain model. This article presents the GloSIS web ontology,
an implementation of the GloSIS domain model with the Web Ontology Language
(OWL). Thoroughly employing a host of Semantic Web standards (SOSA, SKOS,
GeoSPARQL, QUDT), GloSIS lays out not only a soil data ontology but also an
extensive set of ready-to-use code-lists for soil description and
physio-chemical analysis. Various examples are provided on the provision and
use of GloSIS-compliant linked data, showcasing the contribution of this
ontology to the discovery, exploration, integration and access of soil data.

on pretraining models using crafted bi-modal and uni-modal datasets to align

employ bimodal and unimodal pairs extracted from CodeSearchNet for
pre-training, our model exhibits significant performance improvements across a

                                        <span>  Graph augmentation with contrastive learning has gained significant attention
in the field of recommendation systems due to its ability to learn expressive
user representations, even when labeled data is limited. However, directly
applying existing GCL models to real-world recommendation environments poses
challenges. There are two primary issues to address. Firstly, the lack of
consideration for data noise in contrastive learning can result in noisy
self-supervised signals, leading to degraded performance. Secondly, many
existing GCL approaches rely on graph neural network (GNN) architectures, which
can suffer from over-smoothing problems due to non-adaptive message passing. To
address these challenges, we propose a principled framework called GraphAug.
This framework introduces a robust data augmentor that generates denoised
self-supervised signals, enhancing recommender systems. The GraphAug framework
incorporates a graph information bottleneck (GIB)-regularized augmentation
paradigm, which automatically distills informative self-supervision information
and adaptively adjusts contrastive view generation. Through rigorous
experimentation on real-world datasets, we thoroughly assessed the performance
of our novel GraphAug model. The outcomes consistently unveil its superiority
over existing baseline methods. The source code for our model is publicly
available at: https://github.com/HKUDS/GraphAug.

similarity. First, it compares the performance of different kinds of
patent-specific pretrained embedding models, namely static word embeddings
(such as word2vec and doc2vec models) and contextual word embeddings (such as
transformers based models), on the task of patent similarity calculation.
Second, it compares specifically the performance of Sentence Transformers
(SBERT) architectures with different training phases on the patent similarity
task. To assess the models' performance, we use information about patent
interferences, a phenomenon in which two or more patent claims belonging to
different patent applications are proven to be overlapping by patent examiners.
Therefore, we use these interferences cases as a proxy for maximum similarity
between two patents, treating them as ground-truth to evaluate the performance
of the different embedding models. Our results point out that, first, Patent
SBERT-adapt-ub, the domain adaptation of the pretrained Sentence Transformer
architecture proposed in this research, outperforms the current
state-of-the-art in patent similarity. Second, they show that, in some cases,
large static models performances are still comparable to contextual ones when
trained on extensive data; thus, we believe that the superiority in the
performance of contextual embeddings may not be related to the actual
architecture but rather to the way the training phase is performed.

                                        <span>  Following the significant achievements of large language models (LLMs),
researchers have employed in-context learning for text classification tasks.
However, these studies focused on monolingual, single-turn classification
tasks. In this paper, we introduce LARA (Linguistic-Adaptive
Retrieval-Augmented Language Models), designed to enhance accuracy in
multi-turn classification tasks across six languages, accommodating numerous
intents in chatbot interactions. Multi-turn intent classification is notably
challenging due to the complexity and evolving nature of conversational
contexts. LARA tackles these issues by combining a fine-tuned smaller model
with a retrieval-augmented mechanism, integrated within the architecture of
LLMs. This integration allows LARA to dynamically utilize past dialogues and
relevant intents, thereby improving the understanding of the context.
Furthermore, our adaptive retrieval techniques bolster the cross-lingual
capabilities of LLMs without extensive retraining and fine-tune. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that LARA achieves state-of-the-art performance on
multi-turn intent classification tasks, enhancing the average accuracy by 3.67%
compared to existing methods.

on large language models (LLMs). Different from existing approaches that rely
on extensive training with query-document pairs or retrieval-specific
instructions, our method leverages the instruction-following capabilities of
instruction-tuned LLMs for passage reranking without any additional
fine-tuning. To achieve this, we introduce a soft score aggregation technique
and employ pairwise reranking for unsupervised passage reranking. Experiments
on the BEIR benchmark demonstrate that InstUPR outperforms unsupervised
baselines as well as an instruction-tuned reranker, highlighting its
effectiveness and superiority. Source code to reproduce all experiments is

                                        <span>  The rise of large language models (LLMs) has opened new opportunities in
Recommender Systems (RSs) by enhancing user behavior modeling and content
understanding. However, current approaches that integrate LLMs into RSs solely
utilize either LLM or conventional recommender model (CRM) to generate final
recommendations, without considering which data segments LLM or CRM excel in.
To fill in this gap, we conduct experiments on MovieLens-1M and Amazon-Books
datasets, and compare the performance of a representative CRM (DCNv2) and an
LLM (LLaMA2-7B) on various groups of data samples. Our findings reveal that
LLMs excel in data segments where CRMs exhibit lower confidence and precision,
while samples where CRM excels are relatively challenging for LLM, requiring
substantial training data and a long training time for comparable performance.
This suggests potential synergies in the combination between LLM and CRM.
Motivated by these insights, we propose Collaborative Recommendation with
conventional Recommender and Large Language Model (dubbed \textit{CoReLLa}). In
this framework, we first jointly train LLM and CRM and address the issue of
decision boundary shifts through alignment loss. Then, the resource-efficient
CRM, with a shorter inference time, handles simple and moderate samples, while
LLM processes the small subset of challenging samples for CRM. Our experimental
results demonstrate that CoReLLa outperforms state-of-the-art CRM and LLM
methods significantly, underscoring its effectiveness in recommendation tasks.

aiming to model users' dynamic interests from their sequential interactions.
With users increasingly engaging with online platforms, vast amounts of
lifelong user behavioral sequences have been generated. However, existing
sequential recommender models often struggle to handle such lifelong sequences.
The primary challenges stem from computational complexity and the ability to
capture long-range dependencies within the sequence. Recently, a state space
model featuring a selective mechanism (i.e., Mamba) has emerged. In this work,
we investigate the performance of Mamba for lifelong sequential recommendation
(i.e., length>=2k). More specifically, we leverage the Mamba block to model
lifelong user sequences selectively. We conduct extensive experiments to
evaluate the performance of representative sequential recommendation models in
the setting of lifelong sequences. Experiments on two real-world datasets
demonstrate the superiority of Mamba. We found that RecMamba achieves
performance comparable to the representative model while significantly reducing
training duration by approximately 70% and memory costs by 80%. Codes and data
are available at \url{https://github.com/nancheng58/RecMamba}.

                                        <span>  In information retrieval, facet identification of a user query is an
important task. If a search service can recognize the facets of a user's query,
it has the potential to offer users a much broader range of search results.
Previous studies can enhance facet prediction by leveraging retrieved documents
and related queries obtained through a search engine. However, there are
challenges in extending it to other applications when a search engine operates
as part of the model. First, search engines are constantly updated. Therefore,
additional information may change during training and test, which may reduce
performance. The second challenge is that public search engines cannot search
for internal documents. Therefore, a separate search system needs to be built
to incorporate documents from private domains within the company. We propose
two strategies that focus on a framework that can predict facets by taking only
queries as input without a search engine. The first strategy is multi-task
learning to predict SERP. By leveraging SERP as a target instead of a source,
the proposed model deeply understands queries without relying on external
modules. The second strategy is to enhance the facets by combining Large
Language Model (LLM) and the small model. Overall performance improves when
small model and LLM are combined rather than facet generation individually.

of conversational recommender systems. Large language models show promise in
simulating human-like behavior, raising the question of their ability to
represent a diverse population of users. We introduce a new protocol to measure
the degree to which language models can accurately emulate human behavior in
conversational recommendation. This protocol is comprised of five tasks, each
designed to evaluate a key property that a synthetic user should exhibit:
choosing which items to talk about, expressing binary preferences, expressing
open-ended preferences, requesting recommendations, and giving feedback.
Through evaluation of baseline simulators, we demonstrate these tasks
effectively reveal deviations of language models from human behavior, and offer
insights on how to reduce the deviations with model selection and prompting
strategies.

                                        <span>  People enjoy sharing "notes" including their experiences within online
communities. Therefore, recommending notes aligned with user interests has
become a crucial task. Existing online methods only input notes into BERT-based
models to generate note embeddings for assessing similarity. However, they may
underutilize some important cues, e.g., hashtags or categories, which represent
the key concepts of notes. Indeed, learning to generate hashtags/categories can
potentially enhance note embeddings, both of which compress key note
information into limited content. Besides, Large Language Models (LLMs) have
significantly outperformed BERT in understanding natural languages. It is
promising to introduce LLMs into note recommendation. In this paper, we propose
a novel unified framework called NoteLLM, which leverages LLMs to address the
item-to-item (I2I) note recommendation. Specifically, we utilize Note
Compression Prompt to compress a note into a single special token, and further
learn the potentially related notes' embeddings via a contrastive learning
approach. Moreover, we use NoteLLM to summarize the note and generate the
hashtag/category automatically through instruction tuning. Extensive
validations on real scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method compared with the online baseline and show major improvements in the
recommendation system of Xiaohongshu.

                                        <span>  Searching for specific person has great social benefits and security value,
and it often involves a combination of visual and textual information.
Conventional person retrieval methods, whether image-based or text-based,
usually fall short in effectively harnessing both types of information, leading
to the loss of accuracy. In this paper, a whole new task called Composed Person
Retrieval (CPR) is proposed to jointly utilize both image and text information
for target person retrieval. However, the supervised CPR requires very costly
manual annotation dataset, while there are currently no available resources. To
mitigate this issue, we firstly introduce the Zero-shot Composed Person
Retrieval (ZS-CPR), which leverages existing domain-related data to resolve the
CPR problem without expensive annotations. Secondly, to learn ZS-CPR model, we
propose a two-stage learning framework, Word4Per, where a lightweight Textual
Inversion Network (TINet) and a text-based person retrieval model based on
fine-tuned Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) network are learned
without utilizing any CPR data. Thirdly, a finely annotated Image-Text Composed
Person Retrieval (ITCPR) dataset is built as the benchmark to assess the
performance of the proposed Word4Per framework. Extensive experiments under
both Rank-1 and mAP demonstrate the effectiveness of Word4Per for the ZS-CPR
task, surpassing the comparative methods by over 10\%. The code and ITCPR
dataset will be publicly available at

                                        <span>  Nowadays, research into personalization has been focusing on explainability
and fairness. Several approaches proposed in recent works are able to explain
individual recommendations in a post-hoc manner or by explanation paths.
However, explainability techniques applied to unfairness in recommendation have
been limited to finding user/item features mostly related to biased
recommendations. In this paper, we devised a novel algorithm that leverages
counterfactuality methods to discover user unfairness explanations in the form
of user-item interactions. In our counterfactual framework, interactions are
represented as edges in a bipartite graph, with users and items as nodes. Our
bipartite graph explainer perturbs the topological structure to find an altered
version that minimizes the disparity in utility between the protected and
unprotected demographic groups. Experiments on four real-world graphs coming
from various domains showed that our method can systematically explain user
unfairness on three state-of-the-art GNN-based recommendation models. Moreover,
an empirical evaluation of the perturbed network uncovered relevant patterns
that justify the nature of the unfairness discovered by the generated
explanations. The source code and the preprocessed data sets are available at

success of collaborative learning techniques such as Federated Learning (FL)
and Gossip Learning (GL). In these systems, users participate in the training
of a recommender system while maintaining their history of consumed items on
their devices. While these solutions seemed appealing for preserving the
privacy of the participants at first glance, recent studies have revealed that
collaborative learning can be vulnerable to various privacy attacks. In this
paper, we study the resilience of collaborative learning-based recommender
systems against a novel privacy attack called Community Detection Attack (CDA).
This attack enables an adversary to identify community members based on a
chosen set of items (eg., identifying users interested in specific
points-of-interest). Through experiments on three real recommendation datasets
using two state-of-the-art recommendation models, we evaluate the sensitivity
of an FL-based recommender system as well as two flavors of Gossip
Learning-based recommender systems to CDA. The results show that across all
models and datasets, the FL setting is more vulnerable to CDA compared to
Gossip settings. Furthermore, we assess two off-the-shelf mitigation
strategies, namely differential privacy (DP) and a \emph{Share less} policy,
which consists of sharing a subset of less sensitive model parameters. The
findings indicate a more favorable privacy-utility trade-off for the
\emph{Share less} strategy, particularly in FedRecs.

                                        <span>  Recent advances in text-to-video generation have demonstrated the utility of
powerful diffusion models. Nevertheless, the problem is not trivial when
shaping diffusion models to animate static image (i.e., image-to-video
generation). The difficulty originates from the aspect that the diffusion
process of subsequent animated frames should not only preserve the faithful
alignment with the given image but also pursue temporal coherence among
adjacent frames. To alleviate this, we present TRIP, a new recipe of
image-to-video diffusion paradigm that pivots on image noise prior derived from
static image to jointly trigger inter-frame relational reasoning and ease the
coherent temporal modeling via temporal residual learning. Technically, the
image noise prior is first attained through one-step backward diffusion process
based on both static image and noised video latent codes. Next, TRIP executes a
residual-like dual-path scheme for noise prediction: 1) a shortcut path that
directly takes image noise prior as the reference noise of each frame to
amplify the alignment between the first frame and subsequent frames; 2) a
residual path that employs 3D-UNet over noised video and static image latent
codes to enable inter-frame relational reasoning, thereby easing the learning
of the residual noise for each frame. Furthermore, both reference and residual
noise of each frame are dynamically merged via attention mechanism for final
video generation. Extensive experiments on WebVid-10M, DTDB and MSR-VTT
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our TRIP for image-to-video
generation. Please see our project page at https://trip-i2v.github.io/TRIP/.

                                        <span>  Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has emerged as the new trend of generative
diffusion models on image generation. In view of extremely slow convergence in
typical DiT, recent breakthroughs have been driven by mask strategy that
significantly improves the training efficiency of DiT with additional
intra-image contextual learning. Despite this progress, mask strategy still
suffers from two inherent limitations: (a) training-inference discrepancy and
(b) fuzzy relations between mask reconstruction & generative diffusion process,
resulting in sub-optimal training of DiT. In this work, we address these
limitations by novelly unleashing the self-supervised discrimination knowledge
to boost DiT training. Technically, we frame our DiT in a teacher-student
manner. The teacher-student discriminative pairs are built on the diffusion
noises along the same Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE).
Instead of applying mask reconstruction loss over both DiT encoder and decoder,
we decouple DiT encoder and decoder to separately tackle discriminative and
generative objectives. In particular, by encoding discriminative pairs with
student and teacher DiT encoders, a new discriminative loss is designed to
encourage the inter-image alignment in the self-supervised embedding space.
After that, student samples are fed into student DiT decoder to perform the
typical generative diffusion task. Extensive experiments are conducted on
ImageNet dataset, and our method achieves a competitive balance between
training cost and generative capacity.

                                        <span>  Recent innovations on text-to-3D generation have featured Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS), which enables the zero-shot learning of implicit 3D models
(NeRF) by directly distilling prior knowledge from 2D diffusion models.
However, current SDS-based models still struggle with intricate text prompts
and commonly result in distorted 3D models with unrealistic textures or
cross-view inconsistency issues. In this work, we introduce a novel Visual
Prompt-guided text-to-3D diffusion model (VP3D) that explicitly unleashes the
visual appearance knowledge in 2D visual prompt to boost text-to-3D generation.
Instead of solely supervising SDS with text prompt, VP3D first capitalizes on
2D diffusion model to generate a high-quality image from input text, which
subsequently acts as visual prompt to strengthen SDS optimization with explicit
visual appearance. Meanwhile, we couple the SDS optimization with additional
differentiable reward function that encourages rendering images of 3D models to
better visually align with 2D visual prompt and semantically match with text
prompt. Through extensive experiments, we show that the 2D Visual Prompt in our
VP3D significantly eases the learning of visual appearance of 3D models and
thus leads to higher visual fidelity with more detailed textures. It is also
appealing in view that when replacing the self-generating visual prompt with a
given reference image, VP3D is able to trigger a new task of stylized
text-to-3D generation. Our project page is available at

                                        <span>  Diffusion models are just at a tipping point for image super-resolution task.
Nevertheless, it is not trivial to capitalize on diffusion models for video
super-resolution which necessitates not only the preservation of visual
appearance from low-resolution to high-resolution videos, but also the temporal
consistency across video frames. In this paper, we propose a novel approach,
pursuing Spatial Adaptation and Temporal Coherence (SATeCo), for video
super-resolution. SATeCo pivots on learning spatial-temporal guidance from
low-resolution videos to calibrate both latent-space high-resolution video
denoising and pixel-space video reconstruction. Technically, SATeCo freezes all
the parameters of the pre-trained UNet and VAE, and only optimizes two
deliberately-designed spatial feature adaptation (SFA) and temporal feature
alignment (TFA) modules, in the decoder of UNet and VAE. SFA modulates frame
features via adaptively estimating affine parameters for each pixel,
guaranteeing pixel-wise guidance for high-resolution frame synthesis. TFA
delves into feature interaction within a 3D local window (tubelet) through
self-attention, and executes cross-attention between tubelet and its
low-resolution counterpart to guide temporal feature alignment. Extensive
experiments conducted on the REDS4 and Vid4 datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

increasingly popular approach in both live and video-on-demand (VoD)
applications. However, designing a scalable and adaptable framework that
reduces servers energy consumption and supports low latency and high quality
services, particularly for live video streaming scenarios, is still challenging
for Over-The-Top (OTT) service providers. To address such challenges, this
paper introduces a new hybrid P2P-CDN framework that leverages new networking
and computing paradigms, i.e., Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and edge
computing for live video streaming. The proposed framework introduces a
multi-layer architecture and a tree of possible actions therein (an action
tree), taking into account all available resources from peers, edge, and CDN
servers to efficiently distribute video fetching and transcoding tasks across a
hybrid P2P-CDN network, consequently enhancing the users latency and video
quality. We also discuss our testbed designed to validate the framework and
compare it with baseline methods. The experimental results indicate that the
proposed framework improves user Quality of Experience (QoE), reduces client
serving latency, and improves edge server energy consumption compared to
baseline approaches.

                                        <span>  Multimedia applications, mainly video streaming services, are currently the
dominant source of network load worldwide. In recent Video-on-Demand (VoD) and
live video streaming services, traditional streaming delivery techniques have
been replaced by adaptive solutions based on the HTTP protocol. Current trends
toward high-resolution (e.g., 8K) and/or low-latency VoD and live video
streaming pose new challenges to end-to-end (E2E) bandwidth demand and have
stringent delay requirements. To do this, video providers typically rely on
Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to ensure that they provide scalable video
streaming services. To support future streaming scenarios involving millions of
users, it is necessary to increase the CDNs' efficiency. It is widely agreed
that these requirements may be satisfied by adopting emerging networking
techniques to present Network-Assisted Video Streaming (NAVS) methods.
Motivated by this, this thesis goes one step beyond traditional pure
client-based HAS algorithms by incorporating (an) in-network component(s) with
a broader view of the network to present completely transparent NAVS solutions
for HAS clients.

                                        <span>  Audio-visual segmentation (AVS) is a challenging task that involves
accurately segmenting sounding objects based on audio-visual cues. The
effectiveness of audio-visual learning critically depends on achieving accurate
cross-modal alignment between sound and visual objects. Successful audio-visual
learning requires two essential components: 1) a challenging dataset with
high-quality pixel-level multi-class annotated images associated with audio
files, and 2) a model that can establish strong links between audio information
and its corresponding visual object. However, these requirements are only
partially addressed by current methods, with training sets containing biased
audio-visual data, and models that generalise poorly beyond this biased
training set. In this work, we propose a new cost-effective strategy to build
challenging and relatively unbiased high-quality audio-visual segmentation
benchmarks. We also propose a new informative sample mining method for
audio-visual supervised contrastive learning to leverage discriminative
contrastive samples to enforce cross-modal understanding. We show empirical
results that demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark. Furthermore,
experiments conducted on existing AVS datasets and on our new benchmark show
that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) segmentation accuracy.

                                        <span>  In line with the latest research, the task of identifying helpful reviews
from a vast pool of user-generated textual and visual data has become a
prominent area of study. Effective modal representations are expected to
possess two key attributes: consistency and differentiation. Current methods
designed for Multimodal Review Helpfulness Prediction (MRHP) face limitations
in capturing distinctive information due to their reliance on uniform
multimodal annotation. The process of adding varied multimodal annotations is
not only time-consuming but also labor-intensive. To tackle these challenges,
we propose an auto-generated scheme based on multi-task learning to generate
pseudo labels. This approach allows us to simultaneously train for the global
multimodal interaction task and the separate cross-modal interaction subtasks,
enabling us to learn and leverage both consistency and differentiation
effectively. Subsequently, experimental results validate the effectiveness of
pseudo labels, and our approach surpasses previous textual and multimodal
baseline models on two widely accessible benchmark datasets, providing a
solution to the MRHP problem.

generating training data in various generative fields. However, visual
hallucinations, which contain perceptually critical defects, remain a concern,
especially in non-photorealistic styles like cartoon characters. We propose a
novel visual hallucination detection system for cartoon character images
generated by TTI models. Our approach leverages pose-aware in-context visual
learning (PA-ICVL) with Vision-Language Models (VLMs), utilizing both RGB
images and pose information. By incorporating pose guidance from a fine-tuned
pose estimator, we enable VLMs to make more accurate decisions. Experimental
results demonstrate significant improvements in identifying visual
hallucinations compared to baseline methods relying solely on RGB images. This
research advances TTI models by mitigating visual hallucinations, expanding
their potential in non-photorealistic domains.

                                        <span>  Text-to-image person re-identification (TIReID) is a compelling topic in the
cross-modal community, which aims to retrieve the target person based on a
textual query. Although numerous TIReID methods have been proposed and achieved
promising performance, they implicitly assume the training image-text pairs are
correctly aligned, which is not always the case in real-world scenarios. In
practice, the image-text pairs inevitably exist under-correlated or even
false-correlated, a.k.a noisy correspondence (NC), due to the low quality of
the images and annotation errors. To address this problem, we propose a novel
Robust Dual Embedding method (RDE) that can learn robust visual-semantic
associations even with NC. Specifically, RDE consists of two main components:
1) A Confident Consensus Division (CCD) module that leverages the dual-grained
decisions of dual embedding modules to obtain a consensus set of clean training
data, which enables the model to learn correct and reliable visual-semantic
associations. 2) A Triplet Alignment Loss (TAL) relaxes the conventional
Triplet Ranking loss with the hardest negative samples to a log-exponential
upper bound over all negative ones, thus preventing the model collapse under NC
and can also focus on hard-negative samples for promising performance. We
conduct extensive experiments on three public benchmarks, namely CUHK-PEDES,
ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReID, to evaluate the performance and robustness of our
RDE. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results both with and without
synthetic noisy correspondences on all three datasets. Code is available at

                                        <span>  The online community has increasingly been inundated by a toxic wave of
harmful comments. In response to this growing challenge, we introduce a
two-stage ultra-low-cost multimodal harmful behavior detection method designed
to identify harmful comments and images with high precision and recall rates.
We first utilize the CLIP-ViT model to transform tweets and images into
embeddings, effectively capturing the intricate interplay of semantic meaning
and subtle contextual clues within texts and images. Then in the second stage,
the system feeds these embeddings into a conventional machine learning
classifier like SVM or logistic regression, enabling the system to be trained
rapidly and to perform inference at an ultra-low cost. By converting tweets
into rich multimodal embeddings through the CLIP-ViT model and utilizing them
to train conventional machine learning classifiers, our system is not only
capable of detecting harmful textual information with near-perfect performance,
achieving precision and recall rates above 99\% but also demonstrates the
ability to zero-shot harmful images without additional training, thanks to its
multimodal embedding input. This capability empowers our system to identify
unseen harmful images without requiring extensive and costly image datasets.
Additionally, our system quickly adapts to new harmful content; if a new
harmful content pattern is identified, we can fine-tune the classifier with the
corresponding tweets' embeddings to promptly update the system. This makes it
well suited to addressing the ever-evolving nature of online harmfulness,
providing online communities with a robust, generalizable, and cost-effective
tool to safeguard their communities.

we compare the data and methods used for modeling complementary relationships
between products, including simple complementarity and more complex scenarios
such as asymmetric complementarity, the coexistence of substitution and
complementarity relationships between products, and varying degrees of
complementarity between different pairs of products. Next, we classify and
compare the models based on the research problems of complementary
recommendation, such as diversity, personalization, and cold-start.
Furthermore, we provide a comparative analysis of experimental results from
different studies conducted on the same dataset, which helps identify the
strengths and weaknesses of the research. Compared to previous surveys, this

discusses future research directions, and contributes to the advancement of

posthoc explain the prediction of a trained model. Yet, they are not very well
explored in IR. Importantly, feature attribution has rarely been rigorously
defined, beyond attributing the most important feature the highest value. What
it means for a feature to be more important than others is often left vague.
Consequently, most approaches focus on just selecting the most important
features and under utilize or even ignore the relative importance within
features. In this work, we rigorously define the notion of feature attribution
for ranking models, and list essential properties that a valid attribution
should have. We then propose RankingSHAP as a concrete instantiation of a
list-wise ranking attribution method. Contrary to current explanation
evaluation schemes that focus on selections, we propose two novel evaluation
paradigms for evaluating attributions over learning-to-rank models. We evaluate
RankingSHAP for commonly used learning-to-rank datasets to showcase the more
nuanced use of an attribution method while highlighting the limitations of
selection-based explanations. In a simulated experiment we design an
interpretable model to demonstrate how list-wise ranking attributes can be used
to investigate model decisions and evaluate the explanations qualitatively.
Because of the contrastive nature of the ranking task, our understanding of
ranking model decisions can substantially benefit from feature attribution
explanations like RankingSHAP.

neural networks} (GNNs) and \textit{contrastive learning} (CL) have achieved
promising performance. However, they fall short in modeling fine-grained user
preferences and further fail to leverage the \textit{preference-attribute

the issue, we propose a method named \textit{\textbf{K}nowledge-aware

Specifically, we build \textit{user preference representations} and
\textit{attribute fusion representations} upon the attribute information in
knowledge graphs, which are utilized to enhance \textit{collaborative
filtering} (CF) based user and item representations, respectively. To
discriminate the contribution of each attribute in these two types of
attribute-based representations, a \textit{multi-level collaborative alignment
contrasting} mechanism is proposed to align the importance of attributes with
CF signals. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of KDAR over several state-of-the-art baselines. Further analyses
verify the effectiveness of our method. The code of KDAR is released at:

                                        <span>  A typical benchmark dataset for recommender system (RecSys) evaluation
consists of user-item interactions generated on a platform within a time
period. The interaction generation mechanism partially explains why a user
interacts with (e.g., like, purchase, rate) an item, and the context of when a
particular interaction happened. In this study, we conduct a meticulous
analysis of the MovieLens dataset and explain the potential impact of using the
dataset for evaluating recommendation algorithms. We make a few main findings
from our analysis. First, there are significant differences in user
interactions at the different stages when a user interacts with the MovieLens
platform. The early interactions largely define the user portrait which affects
the subsequent interactions. Second, user interactions are highly affected by
the candidate movies that are recommended by the platform's internal
recommendation algorithm(s). Third, changing the order of user interactions
makes it more difficult for sequential algorithms to capture the progressive
interaction process. We further discuss the discrepancy between the interaction
generation mechanism that is employed by the MovieLens system and that of
typical real-world recommendation scenarios. In summary, the MovieLens platform
demonstrates an efficient and effective way of collecting user preferences to
address cold-starts. However, models that achieve excellent recommendation
accuracy on the MovieLens dataset may not demonstrate superior performance in
practice, for at least two kinds of differences: (i) the differences in the
contexts of user-item interaction generation, and (ii) the differences in user
knowledge about the item collections. While results on MovieLens can be useful
as a reference, they should not be solely relied upon as the primary
justification for the effectiveness of a recommendation system model.

                                        <span>  Transformer-based models have revolutionized the field of image
super-resolution (SR) by harnessing their inherent ability to capture complex
contextual features. The overlapping rectangular shifted window technique used
in transformer architecture nowadays is a common practice in super-resolution
models to improve the quality and robustness of image upscaling. However, it
suffers from distortion at the boundaries and has limited unique shifting
modes. To overcome these weaknesses, we propose a non-overlapping triangular
window technique that synchronously works with the rectangular one to mitigate
boundary-level distortion and allows the model to access more unique sifting
modes. In this paper, we propose a Composite Fusion Attention Transformer
(CFAT) that incorporates triangular-rectangular window-based local attention
with a channel-based global attention technique in image super-resolution. As a
result, CFAT enables attention mechanisms to be activated on more image pixels
and captures long-range, multi-scale features to improve SR performance. The
extensive experimental results and ablation study demonstrate the effectiveness
of CFAT in the SR domain. Our proposed model shows a significant 0.7 dB
performance improvement over other state-of-the-art SR architectures.

movements, has gained rising attention for its wide range of realistic
applications. Deep learning approaches greatly improve current lip reading
systems. However, lip reading in cross-speaker scenarios where the speaker
identity changes, poses a challenging problem due to inter-speaker variability.
A well-trained lip reading system may perform poorly when handling a brand new
speaker. To learn a speaker-robust lip reading model, a key insight is to
reduce visual variations across speakers, avoiding the model overfitting to
specific speakers. In this work, in view of both input visual clues and latent
representations based on a hybrid CTC/attention architecture, we propose to
exploit the lip landmark-guided fine-grained visual clues instead of
frequently-used mouth-cropped images as input features, diminishing
speaker-specific appearance characteristics. Furthermore, a max-min mutual
information regularization approach is proposed to capture speaker-insensitive
latent representations. Experimental evaluations on public lip reading datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach under the intra-speaker
and inter-speaker conditions.

content relation mining has received increasing attention in the realm of
artificial intelligence. The challenges of collecting and annotating
high-quality multi-modal data have underscored the significance of few-shot
learning. In this paper, we focus on two critical tasks under this context:
few-shot multi-modal sarcasm detection (MSD) and multi-modal sentiment analysis
(MSA). To address them, we propose Mixture-of-Prompt-Experts with Block-Aware
Prompt Fusion (MoPE-BAF), a novel multi-modal soft prompt framework based on
the unified vision-language model (VLM). Specifically, we design three experts
of soft prompts: a text prompt and an image prompt that extract
modality-specific features to enrich the single-modal representation, and a
unified prompt to assist multi-modal interaction. Additionally, we reorganize
Transformer layers into several blocks and introduce cross-modal prompt
attention between adjacent blocks, which smoothens the transition from
single-modal representation to multi-modal fusion. On both MSD and MSA datasets
in few-shot setting, our proposed model not only surpasses the 8.2B model
InstructBLIP with merely 2% parameters (150M), but also significantly
outperforms other widely-used prompt methods on VLMs or task-specific methods.

various attributes within a social media platform based on post-comment
relationship? In this study, we propose a novel graph-based approach to model
and analyze user interactions within a social media platform based on
post-comment relationship. We construct a user interaction graph from social
media data and analyze it to gain insights into community dynamics, user
behavior, and content preferences. Our investigation reveals that while 56.05%
of the active users are strongly connected within the community, only 0.8% of
them significantly contribute to its dynamics. Moreover, we observe temporal
variations in community activity, with certain periods experiencing heightened
engagement. Additionally, our findings highlight a correlation between user
activity and popularity showing that more active users are generally more
popular. Alongside these, a preference for positive and informative content is
also observed where 82.41% users preferred positive and informative content.
Overall, our study provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and
managing online communities, leveraging graph-based techniques to gain valuable
insights into user behavior and community dynamics.

                                        <span>  Key-value relations are prevalent in Visually-Rich Documents (VRDs), often
depicted in distinct spatial regions accompanied by specific color and font
styles. These non-textual cues serve as important indicators that greatly
enhance human comprehension and acquisition of such relation triplets. However,
current document AI approaches often fail to consider this valuable prior
information related to visual and spatial features, resulting in suboptimal
performance, particularly when dealing with limited examples. To address this
limitation, our research focuses on few-shot relational learning, specifically
targeting the extraction of key-value relation triplets in VRDs. Given the
absence of a suitable dataset for this task, we introduce two new few-shot
benchmarks built upon existing supervised benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we
propose a variational approach that incorporates relational 2D-spatial priors
and prototypical rectification techniques. This approach aims to generate
relation representations that are more aware of the spatial context and unseen
relation in a manner similar to human perception. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method by showcasing its ability
to outperform existing methods. This study also opens up new possibilities for
practical applications.

for a user, it is natural for dissatisfaction to arise. The problem is, that
even if users are dissatisfied, they often do not have the means to resolve
their dissatisfaction. The user cannot alter the source code of the service,
nor can they force the service provider to change. The user has no choice but
to remain dissatisfied or quit the service. User-side realization offers
proactive solutions to this problem by providing general algorithms to deal
with common problems on the user's side. These algorithms run on the user's
side and solve the problems without having the service provider change the
service itself.

language models (LLMs) and their fine-tuned variants. Billions of data are
crawled from the web and fed to LLMs. How can \textit{\textbf{everyday web
users}} confirm if LLMs misuse their data without permission? In this work, we
suggest that users repeatedly insert personal passphrases into their documents,
enabling LLMs to memorize them. These concealed passphrases in user documents,
referred to as \textit{ghost sentences}, once they are identified in the
generated content of LLMs, users can be sure that their data is used for
training. To explore the effectiveness and usage of this copyrighting tool, we
define the \textit{user training data identification} task with ghost
sentences. Multiple datasets from various sources at different scales are
created and tested with LLMs of different sizes. For evaluation, we introduce a
last $k$ words verification manner along with two metrics: document and user
identification accuracy. In the specific case of instruction tuning of a 3B
LLaMA model, 11 out of 16 users with ghost sentences identify their data within
the generation content. These 16 users contribute 383 examples to $\sim$1.8M
training documents. For continuing pre-training of a 1.1B TinyLlama model, 61
out of 64 users with ghost sentences identify their data within the LLM output.
These 64 users contribute 1156 examples to $\sim$10M training documents.

when users lack expertise in a specific domain or are not proficient in the
language of the content. Providing example documents of interest might be
easier for a user. However, such query-by-example scenarios are prone to
concept drift, and the retrieval effectiveness is highly sensitive to the query
generation method, without a clear way to incorporate user feedback. To enable
exploration and to support Human-In-The-Loop experiments we propose
QueryExplorer -- an interactive query generation, reformulation, and retrieval
interface with support for HuggingFace generation models and PyTerrier's
retrieval pipelines and datasets, and extensive logging of human feedback. To
allow users to create and modify effective queries, our demo supports
complementary approaches of using LLMs interactively, assisting the user with
edits and feedback at multiple stages of the query formulation process. With
support for recording fine-grained interactions and user annotations,
QueryExplorer can serve as a valuable experimental and research platform for
annotation, qualitative evaluation, and conducting Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
experiments for complex search tasks where users struggle to formulate queries.

language processing (NLP) but also have the potential to reshape many other
fields, e.g., recommender systems (RS). However, most of the related work
treats an LLM as a component of the conventional recommendation pipeline (e.g.,
as a feature extractor), which may not be able to fully leverage the generative
power of LLM. Instead of separating the recommendation process into multiple
stages, such as score computation and re-ranking, this process can be
simplified to one stage with LLM: directly generating recommendations from the
complete pool of items. This survey reviews the progress, methods, and future
directions of LLM-based generative recommendation by examining three questions:
1) What generative recommendation is, 2) Why RS should advance to generative
recommendation, and 3) How to implement LLM-based generative recommendation for
various RS tasks. We hope that this survey can provide the context and guidance
needed to explore this interesting and emerging topic.

                                        <span>  Large language model (LLM) has marked a pivotal moment in the field of
machine learning and deep learning. Recently its capability for query planning
has been investigated, including both single-modal and multi-modal queries.
However, there is no work on the query optimization capability of LLM. As a
critical (or could even be the most important) step that significantly impacts
the execution performance of the query plan, such analysis and attempts should
not be missed. From another aspect, existing query optimizers are usually
rule-based or rule-based + cost-based, i.e., they are dependent on manually
created rules to complete the query plan rewrite/transformation. Given the fact
that modern optimizers include hundreds to thousands of rules, designing a
multi-modal query optimizer following a similar way is significantly
time-consuming since we will have to enumerate as many multi-modal optimization
rules as possible, which has not been well addressed today. In this paper, we
investigate the query optimization ability of LLM and use LLM to design LaPuda,
a novel LLM and Policy based multi-modal query optimizer. Instead of
enumerating specific and detailed rules, LaPuda only needs a few abstract
policies to guide LLM in the optimization, by which much time and human effort
are saved. Furthermore, to prevent LLM from making mistakes or negative
optimization, we borrow the idea of gradient descent and propose a guided cost
descent (GCD) algorithm to perform the optimization, such that the optimization
can be kept in the correct direction. In our evaluation, our methods
consistently outperform the baselines in most cases. For example, the optimized
plans generated by our methods result in 1~3x higher execution speed than those
by the baselines.

remarkable abilities as few-shot in-context learners (ICL), adept at adapting
to new tasks with just a few demonstrations in the input context. However, the
model's ability to perform ICL is sensitive to the choice of the few-shot
demonstrations. Instead of using a fixed set of demonstrations, one recent
development is to retrieve demonstrations tailored to each input query. The
implementation of demonstration retrieval is relatively straightforward,
leveraging existing databases and retrieval systems. This not only improves the
efficiency and scalability of the learning process but also has been shown to
reduce biases inherent in manual example selection. In light of the encouraging
results and growing research in ICL with retrieved demonstrations, we conduct
an extensive review of studies in this area. In this survey, we discuss and
compare different design choices for retrieval models, retrieval training
procedures, and inference algorithms.

and time-consuming. To overcome such inferiority, directly leveraging web
images to conduct training data becomes a natural choice. Nevertheless, the
presence of label noise in web data usually degrades the model performance.
Existing methods for combating label noise are typically designed and tested on
synthetic noisy datasets. However, they tend to fail to achieve satisfying
results on real-world noisy datasets. To this end, we propose a method named
GRIP to alleviate the noisy label problem for both synthetic and real-world
datasets. Specifically, GRIP utilizes a group regularization strategy that
estimates class soft labels to improve noise robustness. Soft label supervision
reduces overfitting on noisy labels and learns inter-class similarities to
benefit classification. Furthermore, an instance purification operation
globally identifies noisy labels by measuring the difference between each
training sample and its class soft label. Through operations at both group and
instance levels, our approach integrates the advantages of noise-robust and
noise-cleaning methods and remarkably alleviates the performance degradation
caused by noisy labels. Comprehensive experimental results on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of GRIP over the existing
state-of-the-art methods.

                                        <span>  Implicit neural representations for video (NeRV) have recently become a novel
way for high-quality video representation. However, existing works employ a
single network to represent the entire video, which implicitly confuse static
and dynamic information. This leads to an inability to effectively compress the
redundant static information and lack the explicitly modeling of global
temporal-coherent dynamic details. To solve above problems, we propose DS-NeRV,
which decomposes videos into sparse learnable static codes and dynamic codes
without the need for explicit optical flow or residual supervision. By setting
different sampling rates for two codes and applying weighted sum and
interpolation sampling methods, DS-NeRV efficiently utilizes redundant static
information while maintaining high-frequency details. Additionally, we design a
cross-channel attention-based (CCA) fusion module to efficiently fuse these two
codes for frame decoding. Our approach achieves a high quality reconstruction
of 31.2 PSNR with only 0.35M parameters thanks to separate static and dynamic
codes representation and outperforms existing NeRV methods in many downstream
tasks. Our project website is at https://haoyan14.github.io/DS-NeRV.

previous studies. Firstly, lyric translation studies have predominantly focused
on Western genres and languages, with no previous study centering on K-pop
despite its popularity. Second, the field of lyric translation suffers from a
lack of publicly available datasets; to the best of our knowledge, no such
dataset exists. To broaden the scope of genres and languages in lyric
translation studies, we introduce a novel singable lyric translation dataset,
approximately 89\% of which consists of K-pop song lyrics. This dataset aligns
Korean and English lyrics line-by-line and section-by-section. We leveraged
this dataset to unveil unique characteristics of K-pop lyric translation,
distinguishing it from other extensively studied genres, and to construct a
neural lyric translation model, thereby underscoring the importance of a

contemporary research on signal estimation in nonconvex scenarios. In a
noiseless phase retrieval framework, we precisely analyze the method's
performance in the high-dimensional limit when sensing vectors follow a
multivariate Gaussian distribution for two rotationally invariant models of the
covariance matrix C. In the first model C is a projector on a lower dimensional
space while in the second it is a Wishart matrix. Our analytical results extend
the well-established case when C is the identity matrix. Our examination shows
that the introduction of biased spatial directions leads to a substantial
improvement in the spectral method's effectiveness, particularly when the
number of measurements is less than the signal's dimension. This extension also
consistently reveals a phase transition phenomenon dependent on the ratio
between sample size and signal dimension. Surprisingly, both of these models
share the same threshold value.

harness large language models (LLMs) for producing suggestive limitations, by
thoroughly examining the related challenges, practical insights, and potential

to obtain millions of high-quality news articles with just a few lines of code.
Unlike existing news scrapers, we use manually crafted, bespoke content
extractors that are specifically tailored to the formatting guidelines of each
supported online newspaper. This allows us to optimize our scraping for quality
such that retrieved news articles are textually complete and without HTML
artifacts. Further, our framework combines both crawling (retrieving HTML from
the web or large web archives) and content extraction into a single pipeline.
By providing a unified interface for a predefined collection of newspapers, we
aim to make Fundus broadly usable even for non-technical users. This paper
gives an overview of the framework, discusses our design choices, and presents
a comparative evaluation against other popular news scrapers. Our evaluation
shows that Fundus yields significantly higher quality extractions (complete and
artifact-free news articles) than prior work. The framework is available on
GitHub under https://github.com/flairNLP/fundus and can be simply installed
using pip.

                                        <span>  Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of following long and complex
instructions that enable a diverse amount of user tasks. However, despite
Information Retrieval (IR) models using LLMs as the backbone of their
architectures, nearly all of them still only take queries as input, with no
instructions. For the handful of recent models that do take instructions, it's
unclear how they use them. We introduce our dataset FollowIR, which contains a
rigorous instruction evaluation benchmark as well as a training set for helping
IR models learn to better follow real-world instructions. FollowIR builds off
the long history of the TREC conferences: as TREC provides human annotators
with instructions (also known as narratives) to determine document relevance,
so should IR models be able to understand and decide relevance based on these
detailed instructions. Our evaluation benchmark starts with three deeply judged
TREC collections and alters the annotator instructions, re-annotating relevant
documents. Through this process, we can measure how well IR models follow
instructions, through a new pairwise evaluation framework. Our results indicate
that existing retrieval models fail to correctly use instructions, using them
for basic keywords and struggling to understand long-form information. However,
we show that it is possible for IR models to learn to follow complex
instructions: our new FollowIR-7B model has significant improvements (over 13%)
after fine-tuning on our training set.

                                        <span>  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the most powerful weapon for
various graph tasks due to the message-passing mechanism's great local
information aggregation ability. However, over-smoothing has always hindered
GNNs from going deeper and capturing multi-hop neighbors. Unlike GNNs,
Transformers can model global information and multi-hop interactions via
multi-head self-attention and a proper Transformer structure can show more
immunity to the over-smoothing problem. So, can we propose a novel framework to
combine GNN and Transformer, integrating both GNN's local information
aggregation and Transformer's global information modeling ability to eliminate
the over-smoothing problem? To realize this, this paper proposes a
collaborative learning scheme for GNN-Transformer and constructs GTC
architecture. GTC leverages the GNN and Transformer branch to encode node
information from different views respectively, and establishes contrastive
learning tasks based on the encoded cross-view information to realize
self-supervised heterogeneous graph representation. For the Transformer branch,
we propose Metapath-aware Hop2Token and CG-Hetphormer, which can cooperate with
GNN to attentively encode neighborhood information from different levels. As
far as we know, this is the first attempt in the field of graph representation
learning to utilize both GNN and Transformer to collaboratively capture
different view information and conduct cross-view contrastive learning. The
experiments on real datasets show that GTC exhibits superior performance
compared with state-of-the-art methods. Codes can be available at

                                        <span>  Recent methods utilize graph contrastive Learning within graph-structured
user-item interaction data for collaborative filtering and have demonstrated
their efficacy in recommendation tasks. However, they ignore that the
difference relation density of nodes between the user- and item-side causes the
adaptability of graphs on bilateral nodes to be different after multi-hop graph
interaction calculation, which limits existing models to achieve ideal results.
To solve this issue, we propose a novel framework for recommendation tasks
called Bilateral Unsymmetrical Graph Contrastive Learning (BusGCL) that
consider the bilateral unsymmetry on user-item node relation density for sliced
user and item graph reasoning better with bilateral slicing contrastive
training. Especially, taking into account the aggregation ability of
hypergraph-based graph convolutional network (GCN) in digging implicit
similarities is more suitable for user nodes, embeddings generated from three
different modules: hypergraph-based GCN, GCN and perturbed GCN, are sliced into
two subviews by the user- and item-side respectively, and selectively combined
into subview pairs bilaterally based on the characteristics of inter-node
relation structure. Furthermore, to align the distribution of user and item
embeddings after aggregation, a dispersing loss is leveraged to adjust the
mutual distance between all embeddings for maintaining learning ability.
Comprehensive experiments on two public datasets have proved the superiority of
BusGCL in comparison to various recommendation methods. Other models can simply
utilize our bilateral slicing contrastive learning to enhance recommending
performance without incurring extra expenses.

and sequential recommendation has enjoyed considerable prevalence due to its
capacity to encapsulate the dynamic shifts in user interests. However, previous
sequential modeling methods still have limitations in capturing contextual
information. The primary reason is the lack of understanding of domain-specific
knowledge and item-related textual content by language models. Fortunately, the
emergence of powerful language models has unlocked the potential to incorporate
extensive world knowledge into recommendation algorithms, enabling them to go
beyond simple item attributes and truly understand the world surrounding user
preferences. To achieve this, we propose LANCER, which leverages the semantic
understanding capabilities of pre-trained language models to generate
personalized recommendations. Our approach bridges the gap between language
models and recommender systems, resulting in more human-like recommendations.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a series of
experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets, showing promising results
and providing valuable insights into the influence of our model on sequential
recommendation tasks. Furthermore, our experimental codes are publicly
available.

microscopes or whole slide scanners. Utilizing similarity calculations to match
patients based on these images holds significant potential in research and
clinical contexts. Recent advancements in search technologies allow for
implicit quantification of tissue morphology across diverse primary sites,
facilitating comparisons and enabling inferences about diagnosis, and
potentially prognosis, and predictions for new patients when compared against a
curated database of diagnosed and treated cases. In this paper, we
comprehensively review the latest developments in image search technologies for
histopathology, offering a concise overview tailored for computational
pathology researchers seeking effective, fast and efficient image search

audibility or speech intelligibility. A variety of evolving factors related to
technological advances, cinema production and social behaviour challenge our
perception and understanding. This study seeks to formalise and give context to
these influential factors under a wider and novel term referred to as Dialogue
Understandability. We propose a working definition for Dialogue
Understandability being a listener's capacity to follow the story without undue
cognitive effort or concentration being required that impacts their Quality of
Experience (QoE). The paper identifies, describes and categorises the factors
that influence Dialogue Understandability mapping them over the QoE framework,
a media streaming lifecycle, and the stakeholders involved. We then explore
available measurement tools in the literature and link them to the factors they
could potentially be used for. The maturity and suitability of these tools is
evaluated over a set of pilot experiments. Finally, we reflect on the gaps that
still need to be filled, what we can measure and what not, future subjective
experiments, and new research trends that could help us to fully characterise
Dialogue Understandability.

from the perspective of multimedia communication by conducting and analyzing
real-world experiments on four different Metaverse platforms: VR (virtual

three VR platforms. After raising the challenges of the Metaverse streaming and
investigating the potential methods to enhance Metaverse performance, we
propose a remote rendering architecture and verify its advantages through a

                                        <span>  In this paper, we propose a novel parameter and computation efficient tuning
method for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), termed Efficient
Attention Skipping (EAS). Concretely, we first reveal that multi-head
attentions (MHAs), the main computational overhead of MLLMs, are often
redundant to downstream tasks. Based on this observation, EAS evaluates the
attention redundancy and skips the less important MHAs to speed up inference.
Besides, we also propose a novel propagation-of-information adapter (PIA) to
serve the attention skipping of EAS and keep parameter efficiency, which can be
further re-parameterized into feed-forward networks (FFNs) for zero-extra
latency. To validate EAS, we apply it to a recently proposed MLLM called LaVIN
and a classic VL pre-trained model called METER, and conduct extensive
experiments on a set of benchmarks. The experiments show that EAS not only
retains high performance and parameter efficiency, but also greatly speeds up
inference speed. For instance, LaVIN-EAS can obtain 89.98\% accuracy on
ScineceQA while speeding up inference by 2.2 times to LaVIN

into multimodal reasoning. The study addresses two key challenges: the
trivialization of opinions resulting from excessive summarization and the
diversion of focus caused by distractor concepts introduced from images. These
challenges stem from the inductive (bottom-up) nature of existing debating
schemes. To address the issue, we propose a deductive (top-down) debating
approach called Blueprint Debate on Graphs (BDoG). In BDoG, debates are
confined to a blueprint graph to prevent opinion trivialization through
world-level summarization. Moreover, by storing evidence in branches within the
graph, BDoG mitigates distractions caused by frequent but irrelevant concepts.
Extensive experiments validate BDoG, achieving state-of-the-art results in
Science QA and MMBench with significant improvements over previous methods.

                                        <span>  Despite notable progress, speech emotion recognition (SER) remains
challenging due to the intricate and ambiguous nature of speech emotion,
particularly in wild world. While current studies primarily focus on
recognition and generalization abilities, our research pioneers an
investigation into the reliability of SER methods in the presence of semantic
data shifts and explores how to exert fine-grained control over various
attributes inherent in speech signals to enhance speech emotion modeling. In
this paper, we first introduce MSAC-SERNet, a novel unified SER framework
capable of simultaneously handling both single-corpus and cross-corpus SER.
Specifically, concentrating exclusively on the speech emotion attribute, a
novel CNN-based SER model is presented to extract discriminative emotional
representations, guided by additive margin softmax loss. Considering
information overlap between various speech attributes, we propose a novel
learning paradigm based on correlations of different speech attributes, termed
Multiple Speech Attribute Control (MSAC), which empowers the proposed SER model
to simultaneously capture fine-grained emotion-related features while
mitigating the negative impact of emotion-agnostic representations.
Furthermore, we make a first attempt to examine the reliability of the
MSAC-SERNet framework using out-of-distribution detection methods. Experiments
on both single-corpus and cross-corpus SER scenarios indicate that MSAC-SERNet
not only consistently outperforms the baseline in all aspects, but achieves
superior performance compared to state-of-the-art SER approaches.

illusions, attract significant attention. Enjoyment of these videos is not
simply a response to visual stimuli; rather, it hinges on the human capacity to
understand (and appreciate) commonsense violations depicted in these videos. We
introduce FunQA, a challenging video question-answering (QA) dataset
specifically designed to evaluate and enhance the depth of video reasoning
based on counter-intuitive and fun videos. Unlike most video QA benchmarks
which focus on less surprising contexts, e.g., cooking or instructional videos,
FunQA covers three previously unexplored types of surprising videos: 1)
HumorQA, 2) CreativeQA, and 3) MagicQA. For each subset, we establish rigorous
QA tasks designed to assess the model's capability in counter-intuitive
timestamp localization, detailed video description, and reasoning around
counter-intuitiveness. We also pose higher-level tasks, such as attributing a
fitting and vivid title to the video and scoring the video creativity. In
total, the FunQA benchmark consists of 312K free-text QA pairs derived from
4.3K video clips, spanning a total of 24 video hours. Moreover, we propose
FunMentor, an agent designed for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that uses
multi-turn dialogues to enhance models' understanding of counter-intuitiveness.
Extensive experiments with existing VLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of
FunMentor and reveal significant performance gaps for the FunQA videos across
spatial-temporal reasoning, visual-centered reasoning, and free-text
generation.

                                        <span>  Face re-aging is a prominent field in computer vision and graphics, with
significant applications in photorealistic domains such as movies, advertising,
and live streaming. Recently, the need to apply face re-aging to
non-photorealistic images, like comics, illustrations, and animations, has
emerged as an extension in various entertainment sectors. However, the lack of
a network that can seamlessly edit the apparent age in NPR images has limited
these tasks to a naive, sequential approach. This often results in unpleasant
artifacts and a loss of facial attributes due to domain discrepancies. In this
paper, we introduce a novel one-stage method for face re-aging combined with
portrait style transfer, executed in a single generative step. We leverage
existing face re-aging and style transfer networks, both trained within the
same PR domain. Our method uniquely fuses distinct latent vectors, each
responsible for managing aging-related attributes and NPR appearance. By
adopting an exemplar-based approach, our method offers greater flexibility
compared to domain-level fine-tuning approaches, which typically require
separate training or fine-tuning for each domain. This effectively addresses
the limitation of requiring paired datasets for re-aging and domain-level,
data-driven approaches for stylization. Our experiments show that our model can
effortlessly generate re-aged images while simultaneously transferring the
style of examples, maintaining both natural appearance and controllability.

world, short video production has gradually become a popular way of presenting
products information. However, the traditional video production industry
usually includes series of procedures as script writing, video filming in a
professional studio, video clipping, special effects rendering, customized
post-processing, and so forth. Not to mention that multilingual videos is not
accessible for those who could not speak multilingual languages. These
complicated procedures usually needs a professional team to complete, and this
made short video production costly in both time and money. This paper presents
an intelligent system that supports the automatic generation of talking avatar
videos, namely Virbo. With simply a user-specified script, Virbo could use a
deep generative model to generate a target talking videos. Meanwhile, the
system also supports multimodal inputs to customize the video with specified
face, specified voice and special effects. This system also integrated a
multilingual customization module that supports generate multilingual talking
avatar videos in a batch with hundreds of delicate templates and creative
special effects. Through a series of user studies and demo tests, we found that
Virbo can generate talking avatar videos that maintained a high quality of
videos as those from a professional team while reducing the entire production
costs significantly. This intelligent system will effectively promote the video
production industry and facilitate the internet marketing neglecting of
language barriers and cost challenges.

control (such as text prompts, subjects, or styles) to generate a new video
that aligns with the source video and the provided control. Traditional methods
have been constrained to certain editing types, limiting their ability to meet
the wide range of user demands. In this paper, we introduce AnyV2V, a novel
training-free framework designed to simplify video editing into two primary
steps: (1) employing an off-the-shelf image editing model (e.g.
InstructPix2Pix, InstantID, etc) to modify the first frame, (2) utilizing an
existing image-to-video generation model (e.g. I2VGen-XL) for DDIM inversion
and feature injection. In the first stage, AnyV2V can plug in any existing
image editing tools to support an extensive array of video editing tasks.
Beyond the traditional prompt-based editing methods, AnyV2V also can support
novel video editing tasks, including reference-based style transfer,
subject-driven editing, and identity manipulation, which were unattainable by
previous methods. In the second stage, AnyV2V can plug in any existing
image-to-video models to perform DDIM inversion and intermediate feature
injection to maintain the appearance and motion consistency with the source
video. On the prompt-based editing, we show that AnyV2V can outperform the
previous best approach by 35\% on prompt alignment, and 25\% on human
preference. On the three novel tasks, we show that AnyV2V also achieves a high
success rate. We believe AnyV2V will continue to thrive due to its ability to
seamlessly integrate the fast-evolving image editing methods. Such
compatibility can help AnyV2V to increase its versatility to cater to diverse
user demands.

confronted with tasks in which they have to gather information from dispar-ate

significantly complex for humans and often require deep study including
rereading portions of a text. Towards simplifying the task of gathering
in-formation we evaluated LLMs with chat interfaces for their ability to
provide answers to standard questions that a human can be expected to answer
based on their reading of a body of text. The body of text under study is Title
47 of the United States Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) which describes
regula-tions for commercial telecommunications as governed by the Federal
Com-munications Commission (FCC). This has been a body of text of interest
be-cause our larger research concerns the issue of making sense of information
related to Wireless Spectrum Governance and usage in an automated manner to
support Dynamic Spectrum Access. The information concerning this wireless
spectrum domain is found in many disparate sources, with Title 47 of the CFR
being just one of many. Using a range of LLMs and providing the required CFR
text as context we were able to quantify the performance of those LLMs on the
specific task of answering the questions below.

alternative to traditional doctor visits. It highlights the limitations of
existing tools and emphasizes the advantages of using ChatGPT, which provides
real-time, personalized medical diagnosis at no cost. The paragraph summarizes
a research study that evaluated the performance of ChatGPT in Arabic medical
diagnosis. The study involved compiling a dataset of disease information and
generating multiple messages for each disease using different prompting
techniques. ChatGPT's performance was assessed by measuring the similarity
between its responses and the actual diseases. The results showed promising
performance, with average scores of around 76% for similarity measures. Various
prompting techniques were used, and chain prompting demonstrated a relative
advantage. The study also recorded an average response time of 6.12 seconds for
the ChatGPT API, which is considered acceptable but has room for improvement.
While ChatGPT cannot replace human doctors entirely, the findings suggest its
potential in emergency cases and addressing general medical inquiries. Overall,
the study highlights ChatGPT's viability as a valuable tool in the medical
field.

                                        <span>  Distilling large, unstructured text into a structured, condensed form such as
tables is an open research problem. One of the primary challenges in
automatically generating tables is ensuring their syntactic validity. Prior
approaches address this challenge by including additional parameters in the
Transformer's attention mechanism to attend to specific rows and column
headers. In contrast to this single-stage method, this paper presents a
two-stage approach called Generative Tables (gTBLS). The first stage infers
table structure (row and column headers) from the text. The second stage
formulates questions using these headers and fine-tunes a causal language model
to answer them. Furthermore, the gTBLS approach is amenable to the utilization
of pre-trained Large Language Models in a zero-shot configuration, presenting a
solution for table generation in situations where fine-tuning is not feasible.
gTBLS improves prior approaches by up to 10% in BERTScore on the table
construction task and up to 20% on the table content generation task of the
E2E, WikiTableText, WikiBio, and RotoWire datasets.

                                        <span>  In recent years, instruction tuning has gained increasing attention and
emerged as a crucial technique to enhance the capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). To construct high-quality instruction datasets, many instruction
processing approaches have been proposed, aiming to achieve a delicate balance
between data quantity and data quality. Nevertheless, due to inconsistencies
that persist among various instruction processing methods, there is no standard
open-source instruction processing implementation framework available for the
community, which hinders practitioners from further developing and advancing.
To facilitate instruction processing research and development, we present
EasyInstruct, an easy-to-use instruction processing framework for LLMs, which
modularizes instruction generation, selection, and prompting, while also
considering their combination and interaction. EasyInstruct is publicly
released and actively maintained at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyInstruct,
along with an online demo app and a demo video for quick-start, calling for
broader research centered on instruction data and synthetic data.

                                        <span>  Incorporating item content information into click-through rate (CTR)
prediction models remains a challenge, especially with the time and space
constraints of industrial scenarios. The content-encoding paradigm, which
integrates user and item encoders directly into CTR models, prioritizes space
over time. In contrast, the embedding-based paradigm transforms item and user
semantics into latent embeddings, subsequently caching them to optimize
processing time at the expense of space. In this paper, we introduce a new
semantic-token paradigm and propose a discrete semantic tokenization approach,
namely UIST, for user and item representation. UIST facilitates swift training
and inference while maintaining a conservative memory footprint. Specifically,
UIST quantizes dense embedding vectors into discrete tokens with shorter
lengths and employs a hierarchical mixture inference module to weigh the
contribution of each user--item token pair. Our experimental results on news
recommendation showcase the effectiveness and efficiency (about 200-fold space
compression) of UIST for CTR prediction.

                                        <span>  Concurrency is an important aspect of Petri nets to describe and simulate the
behavior of complex systems. Knowing which places and transitions could be
executed in parallel helps to understand nets and enables analysis techniques
and the computation of other properties, such as causality, exclusivity, etc..
All techniques based on concurrency detection depend on the efficiency of this
detection methodology. Kovalyov and Esparza have developed algorithms that
compute all concurrent places in $O\big((P+T)TP^2\big)$ for live and bounded
nets (where $P$ and $T$ are the numbers of places and transitions) and in
$O\big(P(P+T)^2\big)$ for live and bounded free-choice nets. Although these
algorithms have a reasonably good computational complexity, large numbers of
concurrent pairs of nodes may still lead to long computation times. This paper
complements the palette of concurrency detection algorithms with the Concurrent
Paths (CP) algorithm for sound free-choice workflow nets. The algorithm allows
parallelization and has a worst-case computational complexity of $O(P^2 + T^2)$
for acyclic nets and of $O(P^3 + PT^2)$ for cyclic nets. Although the
computational complexity of cyclic nets has not improved, the evaluation shows
the benefits of CP, especially, if the net contains many nodes in concurrency
relation.

that follow text instructions, making it easy to create diverse and individual
content. However, existing approaches mostly focus on high-quality short video
generation (typically 16 or 24 frames), ending up with hard-cuts when naively
extended to the case of long video synthesis. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce StreamingT2V, an autoregressive approach for long video generation of
80, 240, 600, 1200 or more frames with smooth transitions. The key components
are:(i) a short-term memory block called conditional attention module (CAM),
which conditions the current generation on the features extracted from the
previous chunk via an attentional mechanism, leading to consistent chunk
transitions, (ii) a long-term memory block called appearance preservation
module, which extracts high-level scene and object features from the first
video chunk to prevent the model from forgetting the initial scene, and (iii) a
randomized blending approach that enables to apply a video enhancer
autoregressively for infinitely long videos without inconsistencies between
chunks. Experiments show that StreamingT2V generates high motion amount. In
contrast, all competing image-to-video methods are prone to video stagnation
when applied naively in an autoregressive manner. Thus, we propose with
StreamingT2V a high-quality seamless text-to-long video generator that
outperforms competitors with consistency and motion. Our code will be available

                                        <span>  Face presentation attacks (FPA), also known as face spoofing, have brought
increasing concerns to the public through various malicious applications, such
as financial fraud and privacy leakage. Therefore, safeguarding face
recognition systems against FPA is of utmost importance. Although existing
learning-based face anti-spoofing (FAS) models can achieve outstanding
detection performance, they lack generalization capability and suffer
significant performance drops in unforeseen environments. Many methodologies
seek to use auxiliary modality data (e.g., depth and infrared maps) during the
presentation attack detection (PAD) to address this limitation. However, these
methods can be limited since (1) they require specific sensors such as depth
and infrared cameras for data capture, which are rarely available on commodity
mobile devices, and (2) they cannot work properly in practical scenarios when
either modality is missing or of poor quality. In this paper, we devise an
accurate and robust MultiModal Mobile Face Anti-Spoofing system named M3FAS to
overcome the issues above. The primary innovation of this work lies in the
following aspects: (1) To achieve robust PAD, our system combines visual and
auditory modalities using three commonly available sensors: camera, speaker,
and microphone; (2) We design a novel two-branch neural network with three
hierarchical feature aggregation modules to perform cross-modal feature fusion;
(3). We propose a multi-head training strategy, allowing the model to output
predictions from the vision, acoustic, and fusion heads, resulting in a more
flexible PAD. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the accuracy, robustness,
and flexibility of M3FAS under various challenging experimental settings. The

                                        <span>  One primary topic of multimodal learning is to jointly incorporate
heterogeneous information from different modalities. However, most models often
suffer from unsatisfactory multimodal cooperation, which cannot jointly utilize
all modalities well. Some methods are proposed to identify and enhance the
worse learnt modality, but they are often hard to provide the fine-grained
observation of multimodal cooperation at sample-level with theoretical support.
Hence, it is essential to reasonably observe and improve the fine-grained
cooperation between modalities, especially when facing realistic scenarios
where the modality discrepancy could vary across different samples. To this
end, we introduce a sample-level modality valuation metric to evaluate the
contribution of each modality for each sample. Via modality valuation, we
observe that modality discrepancy indeed could be different at sample-level,
beyond the global contribution discrepancy at dataset-level. We further analyze
this issue and improve cooperation between modalities at sample-level by
enhancing the discriminative ability of low-contributing modalities in a
targeted manner. Overall, our methods reasonably observe the fine-grained
uni-modal contribution and achieve considerable improvement. The source code

                                        <span>  There has emerged a growing interest in exploring efficient quality
assessment algorithms for image super-resolution (SR). However, employing deep
learning techniques, especially dual-branch algorithms, to automatically
evaluate the visual quality of SR images remains challenging. Existing SR image
quality assessment (IQA) metrics based on two-stream networks lack interactions
between branches. To address this, we propose a novel full-reference IQA
(FR-IQA) method for SR images. Specifically, producing SR images and evaluating
how close the SR images are to the corresponding HR references are separate
processes. Based on this consideration, we construct a deep Bi-directional
Attention Network (BiAtten-Net) that dynamically deepens visual attention to
distortions in both processes, which aligns well with the human visual system
(HVS). Experiments on public SR quality databases demonstrate the superiority
of our proposed BiAtten-Net over state-of-the-art quality assessment methods.
In addition, the visualization results and ablation study show the
effectiveness of bi-directional attention.

the final presentation of dances. Recently, various methods and datasets have
showcased the feasibility of dance synthesis. However, camera movement
synthesis with music and dance remains an unsolved challenging problem due to
the scarcity of paired data. Thus, we present DCM, a new multi-modal 3D
dataset, which for the first time combines camera movement with dance motion
and music audio. This dataset encompasses 108 dance sequences (3.2 hours) of
paired dance-camera-music data from the anime community, covering 4 music
genres. With this dataset, we uncover that dance camera movement is
multifaceted and human-centric, and possesses multiple influencing factors,
making dance camera synthesis a more challenging task compared to camera or
dance synthesis alone. To overcome these difficulties, we propose
DanceCamera3D, a transformer-based diffusion model that incorporates a novel
body attention loss and a condition separation strategy. For evaluation, we
devise new metrics measuring camera movement quality, diversity, and dancer
fidelity. Utilizing these metrics, we conduct extensive experiments on our DCM
dataset, providing both quantitative and qualitative evidence showcasing the
effectiveness of our DanceCamera3D model. Code and video demos are available at

open-sourced T2V diffusion models struggle to generate longer videos with
dynamically varying and evolving content. They tend to synthesize quasi-static
videos, ignoring the necessary visual change-over-time implied in the text
prompt. At the same time, scaling these models to enable longer, more dynamic
video synthesis often remains computationally intractable. To address this
challenge, we introduce the concept of Generative Temporal Nursing (GTN), where
we aim to alter the generative process on the fly during inference to improve
control over the temporal dynamics and enable generation of longer videos. We
propose a method for GTN, dubbed VSTAR, which consists of two key ingredients:
1) Video Synopsis Prompting (VSP) - automatic generation of a video synopsis
based on the original single prompt leveraging LLMs, which gives accurate
textual guidance to different visual states of longer videos, and 2) Temporal
Attention Regularization (TAR) - a regularization technique to refine the
temporal attention units of the pre-trained T2V diffusion models, which enables
control over the video dynamics. We experimentally showcase the superiority of
the proposed approach in generating longer, visually appealing videos over
existing open-sourced T2V models. We additionally analyze the temporal
attention maps realized with and without VSTAR, demonstrating the importance of
applying our method to mitigate neglect of the desired visual change over time.

modalities, among which supervised CMR is emerging due to its flexibility in
learning semantic category discrimination. Despite the remarkable performance
of previous supervised CMR methods, much of their success can be attributed to
the well-annotated data. However, even for unimodal data, precise annotation is
expensive and time-consuming, and it becomes more challenging with the
multimodal scenario. In practice, massive multimodal data are collected from
the Internet with coarse annotation, which inevitably introduces noisy labels.
Training with such misleading labels would bring two key challenges --
enforcing the multimodal samples to \emph{align incorrect semantics} and
\emph{widen the heterogeneous gap}, resulting in poor retrieval performance. To
tackle these challenges, this work proposes UOT-RCL, a Unified framework based
on Optimal Transport (OT) for Robust Cross-modal Retrieval. First, we propose a
semantic alignment based on partial OT to progressively correct the noisy
labels, where a novel cross-modal consistent cost function is designed to blend
different modalities and provide precise transport cost. Second, to narrow the
discrepancy in multi-modal data, an OT-based relation alignment is proposed to
infer the semantic-level cross-modal matching. Both of these two components
leverage the inherent correlation among multi-modal data to facilitate
effective cost function. The experiments on three widely-used cross-modal
retrieval datasets demonstrate that our UOT-RCL surpasses the state-of-the-art
approaches and significantly improves the robustness against noisy labels.

                                        <span>  Video Action Counting (VAC) is crucial in analyzing sports, fitness, and
everyday activities by quantifying repetitive actions in videos. However,
traditional VAC methods have overlooked the complexity of action repetitions,
such as interruptions and the variability in cycle duration. Our research
addresses the shortfall by introducing a novel approach to VAC, called
Irregular Video Action Counting (IVAC). IVAC prioritizes modeling irregular
repetition patterns in videos, which we define through two primary aspects:
Inter-cycle Consistency and Cycle-interval Inconsistency. Inter-cycle
Consistency ensures homogeneity in the spatial-temporal representations of
cycle segments, signifying action uniformity within cycles. Cycle-interval
inconsistency highlights the importance of distinguishing between cycle
segments and intervals based on their inherent content differences. To
encapsulate these principles, we propose a new methodology that includes
consistency and inconsistency modules, supported by a unique pull-push loss
(P2L) mechanism. The IVAC-P2L model applies a pull loss to promote coherence
among cycle segment features and a push loss to clearly distinguish features of
cycle segments from interval segments. Empirical evaluations conducted on the
RepCount dataset demonstrate that the IVAC-P2L model sets a new benchmark in
VAC task performance. Furthermore, the model demonstrates exceptional
adaptability and generalization across various video contents, outperforming
existing models on two additional datasets, UCFRep and Countix, without the
need for dataset-specific optimization. These results confirm the efficacy of
our approach in addressing irregular repetitions in videos and pave the way for
further advancements in video analysis and understanding.

protecting intellectual property and enhancing artificial intelligence
security. This paper proposes Plug-in Generative Watermarking (PiGW) as a
general framework for integrating watermarks into generative images. More
specifically, PiGW embeds watermark information into the initial noise using a
learnable watermark embedding network and an adaptive frequency spectrum mask.
Furthermore, it optimizes training costs by gradually increasing timesteps.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PiGW enables embedding watermarks into
the generated image with negligible quality loss while achieving true
invisibility and high resistance to noise attacks. Moreover, PiGW can serve as
a plugin for various commonly used generative structures and multimodal
generative content types. Finally, we demonstrate how PiGW can also be utilized
for detecting generated images, contributing to the promotion of secure AI
development. The project code will be made available on GitHub.

complicated process of manipulating intricate character control parameters.
However, current methods are limited by their single-round generation,
incapable of further editing and fine-grained modification. In this paper, we
propose an Interactive Character Editing framework (ICE) to achieve a
multi-round dialogue-based refinement process. In a nutshell, our ICE offers a
more user-friendly way to enable players to convey creative ideas iteratively
while ensuring that created characters align with the expectations of players.
Specifically, we propose an Instruction Parsing Module (IPM) that utilizes
large language models (LLMs) to parse multi-round dialogues into clear editing
instruction prompts in each round. To reliably and swiftly modify character
control parameters at a fine-grained level, we propose a Semantic-guided
Low-dimension Parameter Solver (SLPS) that edits character control parameters
according to prompts in a zero-shot manner. Our SLPS first localizes the
character control parameters related to the fine-grained modification, and then
optimizes the corresponding parameters in a low-dimension space to avoid
unrealistic results. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed ICE for in-game character creation and the
superior editing performance of ICE. Project page: https://iceedit.github.io/.

                                        <span>  Multimodal intent recognition poses significant challenges, requiring the
incorporation of non-verbal modalities from real-world contexts to enhance the
comprehension of human intentions. Existing benchmark datasets are limited in
scale and suffer from difficulties in handling out-of-scope samples that arise
in multi-turn conversational interactions. We introduce MIntRec2.0, a
large-scale benchmark dataset for multimodal intent recognition in multi-party
conversations. It contains 1,245 dialogues with 15,040 samples, each annotated
within a new intent taxonomy of 30 fine-grained classes. Besides 9,304 in-scope
samples, it also includes 5,736 out-of-scope samples appearing in multi-turn
contexts, which naturally occur in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, we
provide comprehensive information on the speakers in each utterance, enriching
its utility for multi-party conversational research. We establish a general
framework supporting the organization of single-turn and multi-turn dialogue
data, modality feature extraction, multimodal fusion, as well as in-scope
classification and out-of-scope detection. Evaluation benchmarks are built
using classic multimodal fusion methods, ChatGPT, and human evaluators. While
existing methods incorporating nonverbal information yield improvements,
effectively leveraging context information and detecting out-of-scope samples
remains a substantial challenge. Notably, large language models exhibit a
significant performance gap compared to humans, highlighting the limitations of
machine learning methods in the cognitive intent understanding task. We believe
that MIntRec2.0 will serve as a valuable resource, providing a pioneering
foundation for research in human-machine conversational interactions, and
significantly facilitating related applications. The full dataset and codes are

with simple entropy models derived from single image codecs to encode latent
representations. However, those entropy models struggle to effectively capture
the spatial-disparity characteristics inherent in stereo images, which leads to
suboptimal rate-distortion results. In this paper, we propose a stereo image
compression framework, named CAMSIC. CAMSIC independently transforms each image
to latent representation and employs a powerful decoder-free Transformer
entropy model to capture both spatial and disparity dependencies, by
introducing a novel content-aware masked image modeling (MIM) technique. Our
content-aware MIM facilitates efficient bidirectional interaction between prior

extra Transformer decoder. Experiments show that our stereo image codec
achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance on two stereo image
datasets Cityscapes and InStereo2K with fast encoding and decoding speed.
